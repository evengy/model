      "Very cool! I think this is a great game! simple but fun mechanics with having to balance dodging with aiming for the next ball, it adds a lot of strategy and moment by moment decision making which is really nice!"

      "My favorite game of this round! knocked it out the park!",
      "Pretty cute, car mode was quite fun, controls are interesting and make for some silly moments. Frog mode just felt like I had to make the cars go in wheelies and abuse the fact they have slow acceleration to survive forever. Either way it was pretty funny with the animations and commentary.",
      "loved the commentary! the game was really\u00a0fun but the frogs were so hard to run over while drifting but its probably just me being bad at games lol, great entry!",
      "Good atmosphere, the 2 player was great fun but I feel the frog had the advantage over the car. Definitely original and definitely a lot of fun on all modes",
      "The commentary really made this game. It was fun, silly and seemed so genuine at times. Feels like most of the games could have benefited from some commentary, I will have to keep this in mind for future jams. Overall, I really enjoyed murdering frogs, great job.",
      "Great commentary! The little frogs scurrying away from my mighty Ford Focus had me dying. What a treat to play! Great work!",
      "Came for the frogs, stayed for the commentary! Really sales the whole competition vibe",
