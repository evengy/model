      "Cant wait to learn more about the story and the back ground, hope you get to the second round",
      "Loved it. Love to see amazing work from a fellow GameMaker user. I played on stream and shared my thoughts while playing if you wanted to watch the playback. Excellent entry.",
      "wow that was cool. nice work, hope to see more.",
      "I really can't wait to see more! I\u00a0want to know the story!!!",
      "The art style and was great, I'd love to see more.",
      "I really love the atmosphere and style of the game, and I would love to see this developed further, and to see this story continued. And that cutscene, that was so incredible omg",
      "Loved the character sprite!\u00a0The feel of the game was eerie and cool, interesting to see where this may go",
      "Really enjoyed the aesthetic here! I'm going to have to try and use a similar style some time, it's just so atmospheric!",
      "This is just beautiful.\u00a0 I need this as a full game.\u00a0 Especially that cutscene.\u00a0 I'm gonna have to study that once this game jam is over.\u00a0 Very nice job all around.+",
      "This isn't what I need to see on a Monday... but it IS what I need to see in round 2!",
      "The setting and atmosphere for the game is awesome, love the screen shake and all of the art that's gone into it.\u00a0It looks really professional and I look forward to what you have got planned for it",
      "Really awesome cinematic effects, graphics and sounds! Strongly reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter which is one of my favorite games. Would love to see you build off of this!",
      "Great work on the assets and the animations, the music with the cinematic effects really sell the whole vibe! The open hands, the details on the walls and tiles as well as the big bois in the end really show you did a lot of work!On suggestion (that you probably thought of already and I am being pedantic) is to add extra stepping SFX if your game has a lot of walking around ( I tried it this round and it adds to the experience). It was no problem at the start, but right before the last 2 turns where there was nothing new for my brain to focus on, it picked up on the pattern and frowned.",
      "I swear I want to play full game. One minus is optimisation? i dont know i had some lags. But really great stuff!",
      "Neat stuff. The flash of dead bodies and the three gaints really reminded me of the intro of Hyper Light Drifter. And the art is quite nice.",
      "I\u00a0love the atmosphere it feels very ominous and foreboding especially with that weird vision the sound effects, plus the art is superb. the only problem is that after my first playthrough when the game reset all the sound stopped playing"

      "Streamed while playing this and commented throughout if you want to watch the playback. Had the game audio set to the wrong channel, but fixed and revisited briefly after the break.",
      "Solid entry! Love the paper cutout style. Also love your very gracious checkpointing haha, without that this would have been quite a bit more frustrating to end. Also I gotta give bonus points for any entries feature a duck, an oversight clearly in my own entry teehee",
      "Ggenius\u00ef\u00bc\u0081",
      "Very unique art style and concept, and some great level design here, would love to see more!",
      "this game is absolutely\u00a0hilarious and i love it!",
      "Ducks are cool.I love the art style and the humor.",
      "Insane. Nice controls, good level design, well polished throughout. Art style is so unique and well executed, reminds me of Getting Over It. Looking forward to\u00a0more ducks and more levels.",
      "I really loved this game, and the way you used stock images was so creative! It came together really well, and I loved the motivational messages too lol",
      "wonderful art direction and fitting music. Love the useless inspirational messages",
      "Lovely game. I really enjoy the positive messages, that is a really nice touch to experience on a Monday :^)",
      "This is one of my favorites. Love the quirkiness of it and it's such fun to play",
      "I absolutely love the style of this game. The art is super cool and I love the almost surrealist styles of ducks, gears, and crates",
      "TEE HEE duckfaced people should be banned for posting signs underneath wooden crate-like structures. Better yet, a future with them being thrown at rotating metal gears is not one I would disagree for.(Great mashup of unique textures, the frequent checkpoints really help a lot players with limited patience *wink wink*. I was joking with duckface-Jerry, he is my friend, can't wait to see him again)",
      "This game is beautiful. I love the\u00a0use of stock images to create this unique bizarre collage world, and I think the ducks holding the wholesome/motivational signs is quite funny and charming and adds to the whole experience. One little thing though, the sound the duck makes when you jump is a bit annoying.",
      "This game is built so well using only stock images! You're definitely making it to round 2, can't wait to see what you have planned next!",
      "For not being able to come up with an idea, this is actually really creative.\u00a0 Great job adapting and getting something together (in essentially half the time, too!)."

      "Tasty, tasty! Had a blast with this on stream. Love the location and I'm really curious to see which approach you'll take with gameplay if we continue our round one entries into round 2. Great stuff, GhostBit.",
      "I like the art style.",
      "The art style for the creatures and level\u00a0were great.",
      "very nice art! Like the colour choices and the enemy animations too!",
      "Very nice candy-themed level! It is also awesome to see how your artstyle has improved over time, nice one Ghostbit :))",
      "Sweet level! I love the lollipop enemies the most, excellent animations all around. Some nitpicks are that the player collision should only be at their feet, and the house and ground sprites are a little out of place due to the inconsistent pixel size and flat texture respectively.",
      "Really cool world you've got here chockfull of\u00a0amazing pixel art. Would love to see those enemies in action! I have one\u00a0nitpick though\u00a0with the gingerbread house; It\u00a0feels off\u00a0due to its black outline and inconsistent\u00a0scale. As the black outline stands out quite a bit,\u00a0(just an idea) you could use this to your advantage by having\u00a0black outlines around sprites to\u00a0indicate\u00a0that\u00a0you can interact with them\u00a0(houses, enemies, items, npcs, player,\u00a0etc). That way players will easily be able to distinguish between the environment and important things.",
      "Wow Ghostbit! The art is really sweet! I went right first and wow! those monsters are my favourite, top quality work of simple leg limps on a detailed body, plus those eyes and mouth are haunting! (well done man! Amazing animations and personality!)",
      "I think you've done a great job with the art style! I love this concept, and am excited to see where you go with the gameplay and story, and future areas of the game!",
      "got to say another great entry by the great ghostbitstudio just wish the collision would be a bit nicer by that I mean you can get stuck on corners and edges real easily\u00a0but other than that just a few wrong z indexes but it is great I would love to see more\u00a0maybe even some combat or something",
      "Haven't seen anything like this before (aside from maybe Candyland, the board game).\u00a0 Pretty well executed.\u00a0 Would liked to have seen a little more of an objective.\u00a0 But I can tell the focus was definitely on the art/visual design.\u00a0 Well done!",
      "Really nice start, I really like\u00a0the mix of colorfulness with some scary monsters! Would love to see where you take this gameplay-wise if you build off of it.",
      "The world is colorful. The world gives me Alice in Wonderland vibes. It's all good, but the only thing I can't explain is the ginger bread house. For some reason, I feel something is off about that building. Maybe it's because it has a different outline or something like that. But besides that, everything looks great.",
      "So beautiful ! Love the colors and the fun but creepy vibe, can't wait to see more, well done !",
      "Cool level. A tiny issue with depth sorting, but that art style is good, and the design looks neat.",
      "cannot wait until i can kill the food bois next round",
      "Yummy! Looking forward to munching on some enemies.",
      "Fantastic art and animation, loving the sweet themed level and can't wait to see what your main character is going to look like",
      "the art here is super cool and I love all the enemy animations. I really hope this makes it to the next round so I can see where you take it!"

      "Was able to stream it earlier tonight. Had a blast exploring and even though I promised not to, I got stuck at the waterfall ... I need to be more careful! Great entry. Well done.",
      "Cool level, I'm excited to see more. I enjoy the textures and the feel of this planet.",
      "Really cool looking world, I like the textures a lot, and the alien trees. I liked that you had the waterfall going, that was neat. Kind of a liminal space kind of place. I'm wondering if you continued it what other things the player would see. More types of flora/fauna, any moving creatures, or maybe fossils of some type. And the goals of the exploration mission could lead in a lot of directions.",
      "Pretty nice little game! the colors were really nice and I\u00a0liked the 3d models.",
      "This is a very beautiful looking level.",
      "Really colourful and fun environment, nice use of elevation on the level too.",
      "I love the color palette.\u00a0 CMYK is always an interesting choice.\u00a0 Super trippy, but in a really good way.\u00a0\u00a0Looking forward to seeing what you do with this.\u00a0 Great work!",
      "An outstanding, unique level!",
      "While I did indeed get stuck on the geometry by the waterfall, it was ok because it's a nice waterfall to look at! Interested to see where this could do if you do have the time.",
      "This is so surreal I love it. Gorgeous game. Thank you for submitting it!",
      "I love it ! So bizarre and creative, I love the texture it add so much little details, and the waterfall is gorgeous!",
      "So unique the location is!",
      "I really like the models and the colors, especially the waterfall. I'd like to see where you'd take this.",
      "I like the vibrant atmosphere and the gorgeous waterfall! A dark sky would give a nice contrast to the landscape. Awesome!!",
      "Love the colours and the crazy alien plants. The waterfall also looks pretty. Nice job! It's also really neat that you included your concept art!"

      "Goodio! Stonehenge is a sick place for a game, and the alien theme really adds to it.",
      "Pretty cool game! I liked the concept and the game play was fun.\u00a0I liked having to multitask with attacking the aliens and building",

      "Cool game where you have to balance objectives! Could see powerups and other shenanigans going on as this game gets built (no pun intended) :P",

      "I swear I was\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u008f THIS close to using Stonehenge as my unique location as well hahaha. If you intend to build on this game, I\u00a0would recommend you have the rotation controls just be A and D or the scroll wheel, and have them\u00a0work on whichever block is currently picked up - it would make the controls much more intuitive!",
      "Fun little clicker, definitely have potential. for more types of aliens and interactions, and maybe more monuments. Good job!",
      "1st round: aliens destroyed me, desperately tried to protect the stones.",
      "It's good fun, love that you actually get to see the stone henge being built and destroyed by aliens. Would love to see the aliens move positions from time to time but love how more come in and you have to balance building with defending and attacking",
      "Interesting idea.\u00a0 It actually gives me an idea for my own project (adding that to my game dev notebook!).\u00a0 Using mouse to both move the paddles AND click the aliens might be a little much in the long run.\u00a0 Typically, one button, one action is sort of the expected rule in video games (though not always the case, of course).\u00a0 Just my opinion, of course.\u00a0 All around, great job!",
      "Neat little concept, with a lot of room to build off of! I'm not sure if there was a way to and I was just missing it, but I wish I could have rotated the second block that I\u00a0had control of instead of just one of them.",
      "Fairly simple, but an interesting pretext. Though I imagine you could only go so far with stonehenge iteslf in terms of complexity (blocking with the large rocks), I think it could be interesting if it was a game where each level was some monument with a unique challenge. Could be a party game in a way, always about defeating out those pesky aliens.",
      "Wonderful idea, unique location, whats not to like about smashing aliens",
      "This was fun! I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to rotate one of the blocking stones, but I that might have been a me problem."

      "Best entry I've played so far. Beautiful artwork and really cool post apocalyptic environment. The level was very well mapped out for a metroidvania type game and the character was cool (reminded me of the movies 'Chappie' and 'I am Mother'). Amazing stuff!",
      "Very cool game. I found a cave where was a levitating monster and a lot of coins. It would have been nice to see the monster actually doing something in the future.",
      "Nice entry all around, fun moody atmosphere. I managed to find the little cave of the coins and sinister monster (and of course, ride on its head for a moment haha). Couple places felt a little too dark, you can lighten colors but then hue shift to cools to make a little more visible, since some platforms were rather hard to see. Nice work, curious to see where it goes!",

      "Love the styling and polish, especially the main menu. One thing I would change is to make sure all platforms and important elements have high contrast with the background, e.g. your ashy friend would be a lot more visible if they\u00a0had glowy eyes or lit up the background behind them",
      "This is really impressive. I can tell a lot of thought and effort has gone into its making, love the atmosphere you have created and the art and colours are really nice"

      "fun game, like race the sun (and other such games). Not sure if I like that you can choose your speed, but not a problem as it isn't a mechanics round :)",
      "OK! So I installed Firefox and it was a much smoother experience. I also don't know why on stream I thought we had to go incredibly fast. Probably just being competitive. This morning I played and dialed way back on my speed (I'm not sure how I didn't realize you could decelerate) and it was a blast!If anything, I would suggest you clamp the top speed to a level that's intense but still playable, instead of letting it get up to something that's going to be uncontrollable. Not that mechanics and gameplay are part of the rating this time. But I had a lot more fun when I mellowed out on the speed, but I also think most people will tend to push it speed wise.",

      "The first time I tried this I got a jump scare because I was going too fast and died LMAO",
      "The first impression that this game gives is that I'm like in a dream.",
      "This game is really atmospheric!",
      "The aesthetic is really cool, but audio and video.\u00a0 Most of the suggestions I would make others have already\u00a0said, so I won't really rehash them.\u00a0 A really nice entry all around.\u00a0\u00a0Nice work!",
      "I reached the end in 265 seconds with a final score of 45. At first I went far too fast but I learnt pretty quick. Love how the massive object rises in the distance, not sure how the score is calculated but I think this game has a lot of potential and the environment is pretty cool",
      "it looks cool but a little bit difficult, also im not sure wether its supposed to be in first person pov or third, since at the end you see yourself, cool game overall\u00a0 tho",
      "Great speedrunning concept where you set your own difficulty by accelerating. The neon surreal landscape is nice though I have to\u00a0admit quite common in such forward scrolling games",
      "Nice game, funky world is definitely unique. From a gameplay standpoint (which is not what this round is about, but hey feedback is always nice right?) I think it would help to have a physical representation of yourself/your width or some vehicle onscreen, so you can judge where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at.",
      "I loved the game, it was fun to play. I couldn't handle the speed because there were points where I couldn't see the difference between close and far objects sometimes. The art style was good and I am intrigued about what could be going on.",
      "I really enjoyed the art style but though the game was a bit too difficult. I had to slow down a lot because when I was going to fast I couldn't see the obstacles in front of me. but still overall a nice game",
      "I finished it, but I had to slow down as the smaller monoliths(?) were difficult to see when I was going super fast, took me 135ish seconds :)Interesting other worldly landscape and I love the huge looming thing in the sky it was a cool sci-fi oppressive feeling kind of level. Nice!"

Level design is hard to rate since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an open tub, but I could imagine lots of obstacles or things to contend with like foam or draining water or other toys.

      "Nice simple game with good art.",

      "I played on stream and left feedback throughout my session if you want to watch it. I loved this game. It was right up my alley and I think you put together a very thoughtful layout and level of challenge. Really fun entry. Great work.",
      "This was quite hard (almost too hard), but super fun!\u00a0I gave up at around 600 seconds at the 1 cube jumps i couldn't get to the top of that thing. I agree with what everyone else is saying about the screen shake, but it is a fun game.",
      "Challenging but well made platformer. Only thing I would change is to relax on the screen shake, it is a little too much.",
      "i really liked the game, it was pretty hard. would love to see more of it! 10/10.",
      "Very annoying game, but in a good way. The game is fun and challenging.",
      "frustrating! So fast paced it is addictive (\"Just one more try!\")",
      "really nice and responsive, nice music and sound design, controls are good, and the art is also not bad, overall really nice little speedrunning platformer game",
      "The sounds and screen shake on death really give a nice atmosphere.",
      "This was a blast to play! Instant replay compensates the difficulty of the game. Great work!!",
      "I love a good speedrunning game. Great level design and the art and theme are nice as well.\u00a0 As others have mentioned it can be quite challenging as the movement is fast and sensitive.",
      "A super nice clean and polished game.\u00a0it was very challenging but super rewarding to complete",
      "Simple, but effective.\u00a0 The artwork and music were both really nice.\u00a0 Would love to see this in a full game.\u00a0 Great work!",
      "Deaths = 51, Time = 320 on my first try.\u00a0 Really great game, the checkpoints were in good positions and the challenge was fair and fun and very well thought out. Love the background art and the music is nicely done",
      "Oh boi i died toooo many times. Love that it has checkpoints :DAlso the juice and the sound fax are pretty good too. Art is honestly just epic.I don't have much to complain about lol, but ig you should make it so that you can press \"W\" to jump.Overall, veri epic game. Enjoyed playing it :D",
      "death 62, time 244 is this a good result? :) i am challenging myself to win with 0 deathes",
      "Under 100 deaths! And what a level bop in the background <3"

      "I liked the concept. The art style is minimalism, but it suited the level really well. I\u00a0did have a lot of stuttering going on (running on an RTX 3070 with decent CPU and memory), so I'm not sure what was going on there.",

      "niiiice art style! I found it too frustrating lol, but was good looking game.",
      "I love this art style, it feels really polished and clean. I enjoyed the double jump a lot too, I found that super fun, and how you let the player figure it out, instead of outrightly saying there is a double jump, you let the player experiment and find out themselves!",
      "Well done all around.\u00a0 The color palette works really nicely.\u00a0 Challenging, but not brutally hard platforming.\u00a0 Really looking forward to seeing more from this game.\u00a0 Great work!",
      "This is really awesome! when you got to the first pipe at the end of the first level, i was really wanting more.. and bam! Looking forward to seeing what you do next!",
      "Very polished game!",
      "Very nice art, all the elements work very well together.",
      "Nice artstyle and movement! Please add checkpoint I am literally dying in real life because of this game! 5/5",
      "Being inside a pixelart clocktower with pipes and acid, was nicely conveyed with chains, animations and the tileset. Nice effects!",
      "Plays really nice, love the animation of the background and it's a great first level. My only wish would be if the pipes served as checkpoints as it can be a little frustrating if have to restart at the beginning",
      "The art of this game is great!",
      "Great job! Juicy but a little difficult for me.",
      "I love the idea of being in a clock! But the moving platforms just seem a bit off . I don't know how to say it honestly.One thing you could try is making every platform move with the beat of the clock, like the platform moves a bit every second instead of it being just constant.Also, for some reason, I kept slipping off the platforms, like if I was on the edge I just kinda...fall. That was kinda annoying \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0095.But OH BOI art was amazing. Honestly love the platformer controls (except that part where i fall of a platform when i am too near an edge) like honestly like the slipperiness in it. Also the levels were pretty good imo :))",
      "Great job! Other than location which could use more justification for being unique, I really like the game. Controls feel great which is the point.",
      "Art and effects are really awesome! Maybe there is little lack of uniqueness but great stuff anyway",
      "simple but extremely polished :)",
      "A fellow game entry that deals with clocks in some manners! Very nice art style, bold but still smooth in a way, and the green ooze with those animations are fantastic. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to see all of it since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not very good at platformers ha, so I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accurate to say indeed \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would want to see more levels of this game\u00e2\u0080\u009d .. but also checkpoints :)",

This is fantastic!First, the mechanics of the ship with the four thrusters, the star at the center fitting not only the story but also creating a gravitational pull that the player actually has to work with was wow!Art styles with limited palettes is something I adore, and your planets really looked beautiful in the background with small details like cacti (genius).

One thing that bugs me is how everything goes all glitchy when you get to the border, maybe instead there could be a fade to black or something? To make it more clear that it's a border, and hide the glitch. I love this, and I hope you get through to the next round!",

There are some very small bugs like sometimes when you walk and jump at the same time, it still looks like the character would be walking in the air. Also when going to the boundaries of the map it seems to be jumping back to the area. And last thing is if I press for example A and W at the same time, the planet will move towards the top left corner but only 1 of the thruster is on. But overall it's a very good game!",
      "Dav, bud, this was brilliant. It's been excellent seeing the updates in the discord and well....it's lived up to the hype, really great atmosphere. The worldbuilding's excellent too!",
      "Unique idea for sure, and such attention to detail with all the little planets and variety. Nice style and atmospherics too with the music and sound effects.",
      "This is a really cool idea and I love the art style.",
      "It's really cool to be moving a whole planet* around, the idea of that is cool. There are probably a lot of ways you could take this project. Something about this makes me think it could become something special. It's like Fez where it's a unique mechanic. But the calming music and simple yet still effective graphics make me think Seiklus. I'm not sure which direction you'll take it, but I'm interested in seeing how this project evolves. Also, the flame effect is really cool.",
      "Pretty darn kool :)",
      "What a brilliant idea to move the ship and the people in it using different controls.",
      "This was a great experience and you can see how much love is put into every detail of this game: from the\u00a0sounds and\u00a0the colors to the aliens and their\u00a0dad jokes (Especially the dad jokes). It was great to play this and I definitely would love to see more of it! 10/10",
      "super cool! love how you move both the character and ship!",
      "Nice idea for the round ship. great sound effects and music to bring it all together. I also liked the colour palette you chose :)",
      "From looking at other comments I'd agree that a little direction for the player could be nice.\u00a0 Besides that, though, the controls feel really great and the art has an amazing charming and mysterious feel to it.\u00a0 Great job.",
      "Really charming aesthetic! I enjoyed getting to chat with all the aliens. Nice work!",
      "Interesting game idea. It needs more help for the player (as an example: I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t knew where I had to go)",
      "I would love to try your game but my potato PC lag so much for HTML games... is there any way to add an EXE version ? I would understand if not, but at least I try ahah."

      "I love the music and sound effects, and your concept is really fun to play and unique!",
      "this game is cool and id love to see more, but i feel that the attacks kind of lack some diversity, usally those kind of games especially stickman fights have more than just kick and punch, especially that in your case we can kick while in the air and punch while n the ground, the locqtion in itself isnt really unique but the way the level is presented is, overall a great game",
      "This is really cool. Love the way the character animates when attacking and rolling, especially those jumping head kicks. Everything just feels right about it, I can see see this doing really well in this jam",

      "Honestly this submission blew me away. Everything feels polished, the animations are spectacular and satisfying, and the level is simple yet very effective.",
      "Really cool, I love the whole arts and crafts theme and could see some interesting future mechanics with that in mind.",
      "Its the small touches in this game that blow my mind. like when you jump run and land on the ground you roll or how if you punch in the air you kick. plush the sound effects and music are on point"

Curious to see how this develops.",

      "Great accomplishment. Wonderful use of art and feel good speedy character. Obviously you know the points about the difficulty so I won't bother saying, and it is not a task about gameplay anyway.\u00a0 looks nice and has a flow in the level which is good.",
      "I hate it. 5/5",
      "I agree with others about the difficulty, maybe a practice mode with checkpoints and no chasing would have made learning the level less frustrating? The art is great and it was still fun to beat, here is myspeedrun video",
      "Wow. What can I say, this is absolutely brilliant. Probably the best I played so far in this jam and I've played a lot.\u00a0The art is astonishing and love the movement feel and abilities of the character. As others have mentioned, it is definitely on the steeper side of the difficulty curve. I managed to get past the two drop down sections and then a little way up the next up section in my first 15 minutes of playing, which is probably about 13 seconds of gameplay, I died a lot but learned with it. I\u00a0would love to see a video of the whole level or know if I was close to beating the level?\u00a0I think the shadow chasing the player is really cool but probably work best as a last level boss. I think introducing the character's abilities in a safer place for a first level would work best but I must admit I did enjoy playing this game a lot and may have to come back to it and see if I can complete it",
      "I\u00a0have a lot to say so here we go.First the positives. The art is absolutely amazing and I love the use of particles for the thing chasing you and the hazards. the player also controls really nicely feeling super tight, snappy, and responsive. But there are some Negatives as well. Like many have already said the game is brutally difficult, it took me almost 45 minutes to complete. A lot of that is down to two parts in the game that made it kind of frustrating to play, the level design and the death.",
      "Dark souls level of difficulty but visually great and gameplay is rewarding when you hit the right notes.",
      "Damn this game is quite hard but really\u00a0fun.\u00a0I could see this becoming a popular speed running game with way more levels.",
      "Very challenging! I can definitely see this as a couple levels in where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten a chance to deal. You have some unforgiving placements of those pesky slime walls :p Nice art style, popin music, well done."

      "Enjoyed it, the space theme is very generic though, and it's easy to lose yourself in the maze.",
      "I enjoyed the game, and the maze sequence was a nice twist.",
      "The first part of the game was what I liked the most but the maze was well made too and having the line on the walls was a nice touch. The asteroids and the collision it makes looks and sounds super cool and if there is one feature I would want it would be having the option to invert the axis of the controls",
      "Its a nice game but you basically made 2 levels. Not a bad game but your game counts as 2 levels",
      "Controls felt nice.\u00a0 There wasn't a lot of contrast on the asteroids\u00a0(at least on my computer).\u00a0 It made it hard to move out of the way in time.\u00a0 All in all, though, a good submission.\u00a0\u00a0Curious to see where you go with this.",
      "I really enjoyed the controls of the ship It felt super fun to weave through asteroids or dodge one at the last second. the models while not super complex were still really nice",
      "I have to say the setting of a spaceship flying though an asteroid field is not the most unique, but it is still an interesting level nonetheless and I\u00a0enjoyed playing it.",
      "Major props to the sound and music. It really sold the atmosphere and intensity. I always felt under the pump and like I was in an action movie! Could use some minor polishing such as textures, and a starry background",
      "It was hard to see the asteroids on my computer until they were too close, so it was mostly luck that got me through. I loved the maze, I'm always happy to play through a maze."

Also a clever idea to have sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctasks\u00e2\u0080\u009d to force us testers of your level to seek out different places, very smart move. Nice work.",

I like that you have the ability to crouch and the camera and general movement\u00a0is nice",

If you enter the castle from the beach, the castle door is closed indicates that it is already night. I don't know if that's true :)",

      "Really awesome level! I loved the way the clock face turned\u00a0\u00a0when you went to the different areas, and the 3d models were super good. the only small thing is that sometimes I could see the models appearing when I entered a new area",

      "I had a great time playing with you on stream. Excellent entry and thanks for giving me the live tour. What you put together is so incredibly technically impressive, but also a cool location and well-thought out level. Top marks. I did jump back in off stream and it didn't have any slow-downs or hiccups. I still couldn't make the jump out of the lava back onto the ground though (if that's even possible).",
      "Absolutely insane to have made a whole\u00a0mini MMO in just 2 weeks. on top of that the models are really nice",

      "Cool style and I\u00a0loved the puzzles.",
      "Very cool style. Besides what's already been said, I really liked the colors and the effect on the bg water.",

      "i thought ahnaf30e was joking but when i played it, it actually was surprisingly emotional even though there were just three puzzles and roughly 3 minutes of gameplay, I have no idea what wizardry you did to make me emotional over some (really good/well designed) fishy puzzles, but i applaud it.",
      "This game has truly been an emotional rollercoaster for me. I have felt a wide range of emotions all at once, and I honestly don't know how to express them all. The characters have evoked feelings of sadness, anger, happiness, and excitement all within the same 5 minutes of playing. I felt like I was truly a part of the game's world. The soundtrack has also added to the emotional intensity, with its powerful and moving melodies. Overall, this game has given me an experience that I will never forget and has left me with a sense of awe and wonder. I can say that it has truly been a journey that has left me with a range of 10 different emotions all at once.Overall, Very epic and beautiful game.",

      "Really nice mechanics! I liked the sound effects that the left and right click made and just sat there making drum beats with the sounds lol! The movement was very fluid!\u00a0Great job! Also, while the larger field of view is nice, i feel that having it closer to the player, like the default mode, makes it feel more immersive. Great job!",
      "I love the artwork, really unique level.",
      "This is sick! Very impressive artwork, I have to begin stalking you online!Great mechanics and fighting skillset on the character as well, really enjoyed your focus on the world and leaving the player blank, along with your statement against damage etc. Thumbs up\"The colour palette adds so much to the creepy world, with the shading, animations and the dismembered Patrick... wow you sure went for it!",
      "The art and setting for the game is really well done, loving the crystals coming towards the character as well as the enemies",
      "this is such a cool game! the animations and art are really great and I loved the atmosphere",
      "Excellent art! Love the animations and the small details like the swords on the ground. This could definitely sell in the asset store. Full marks from me!",
      "Parallax effects are enjoyable",
      "Very nice and well done graphics, you put the effort in for sure! Creepy, intriguing parallax world setting. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but wonder more about the looming eye.",
      "Great art, this is really cool.",
      "Really like the art of this entry. It looks fantastic."

      "Alright, back playing it on my windows machine: Fantastic work! Really nice, earie visuals. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a big fan of the dynamic lighting in 3D with 2D cutouts. Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite get that last step from atop the gaurdian (space bar to pull seemed to not do anything?), but also appreciated the detail of the little graveyard in the corner (or maybe I was supposed to do something with that ha idk).",

      "Pretty cool game! reminded me of flappy bird or the helicopter game. This was tricky as you had to account for the momentum of each gravity change!",
      "Fun concept! Flappy bird, but you have to pay even more attention to momentum and plan a few moments ahead (though with the current level, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple enough to flip flip keep pressing space while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the middle, since all obstacles are on the top or bottom, but I get there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of room for there to be other obstacles in the future). The camera perspective definitely makes it a bit more interesting than a traditional side scroller of the same mechanic.",
      "has potential as an addictive mobile game if you can get the artsyle more professional and more levels. Not sure it fits the theme of the Jam though :)",
      "The gravity switching is cool and smooth. The level is quite hard in the beginning. Also I have to say, it's not very unique level as the task was to create one.",
      "Like the gravity switching, as well as the abstract location! Would love to see more levels for this game",
      "simple game but pretty fun.",
      "Flipping the gravity is a really cool mechanic, I feel like trying to stay in the middle was quite tricky but manageable and maybe should have appeared a bit later on but it was fun to play and love the lighting and shadows in the game",
      "The base game is definitely there.\u00a0 You can expend on what you have in so many different directions.\u00a0 Since this is a challenge focused on art and visual design, I would like to see a more unique location.\u00a0 But overall, your pieces are all in place.\u00a0 Nice work!",
      "Cool base mechanic of swapping gravity direction, an idea for adding a bit more depth to it might be having some obstacles floating in the center, to work around the player just hovering in the middle. Could definitely use some more detail or uniqueness on the level or art style though, as it's a bit straightforward."

      "Fun game! I\u00a0was able to beat hard mode, but expert eluded me. Nice art style and music as well. I\u00a0feel like the respawn needs to be almost instant for a game like this, kind of like Super Meat Boy or similar games , to keep the action going non-stop! I\u00a0would also start the timer at the beginning of the level and skip the drink all together. Overall, nice work, can't wait to see more!",
      "Really liking the style of the game, I didn't make it to the end of the level unfortunately but enjoyed what I got to play.\u00a0\u00a0I think being able to skip the intro would be nicer. Being a cat that can scratch down was a lot of fun and love the enemies and whole design of everything",
      "really great little arcade game with a really unique concept, only problem is that we can't skip the first scene so thats kindof anoying having to see it everytime",
      "The strongest thing about this game is the\u00a0\"one more try\" aspect, I really liked the game pushing me to try to make it just in\u00a0time.",
      "I really like the concept of cute kitten unleashing hell on enemies and I think the\u00a0art style adds to this idea really nicely. I\u00a0would suggest however remapping the keybinds for killing and drinking to the same key, one\u00a0that's\u00a0easier to access (perhaps space). This way there isn't a clutter of keys the player has to\u00a0manoeuvre\u00a0their hands across the keyboard\u00a0to press, and you'd have one key that is associated with killing/activation of killing.",
      "It's really fun, awesome sound effects and music too!",
      "Cute cat!",
      "I really love the artstyle and the music and sfx, and the little cat is adorable, which is ironic considering what the game is. sometimes i found it a bit hard to attack the enemies but apart from that it was super fun!"

      "This is so much fun, I loved the controls, really feels like you are driving around a shopping cart. I love the art style, and I loved crashing into everything lol, I tried a few times and didn't manage to win, but I came close a few times, and still had fun anyways.",
      "Unique idea of zipping around a store! Feels good to drift (would be visually more fun if the cart turned slowly, but hey that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the scope of this round anyhow). Nice work.",
      "I love the art style of this game. It's very fun to play, and I can see this being a full game pretty easily.",
      "Welcome to Costco. I love you. It feels good to be loved. Fun objective racer. I enjoyed playing this one on stream and left feedback throughout. Loved you taking a real-world location and making it fun to play in. Well done.",
      "Great game, it was fun sliding around the store.",
      "I managed to win with about 5 seconds left. It's a really nice game with many artistic details in the whole supermarket and the game has really good controls",
      "I really enjoyed this game. the controls felt a little slippery and hard to control but it was still pretty fun. the art was also pretty nice",
      "I love the style and the game play is fun and wacky. I can't find the 6th present though. Otherwise, a fun chaotic experience.",
      "The handcrafted feel of this is kind of refreshing.\u00a0 Would love to actually have music like that when shopping at Costco's."

      "really like the sky, and while normally I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a big fan of first person platformers/jumping games, I at least appreciate that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too much inertia so you feel you can control the character",
      "Some trouble with the mouse sensitivity, but once I worked it out, it was real challenge. I appreciate you having music, but I thought it might have worked better with just some more ambient cold-sounding noises ... if that makes any sense! Game looks great. Great job with this entry.",
      "This was a fun and pretty to look at. Well done.",
      "Like others have said, the mouse sensitivity was far too high for but, the skybox is gorgeous and the gameplay is fun!\u00a0Nice work!",
      "pretty good game with one major problem. the art was nice and the gameplay was fun except for the massive lag that would happen every time I looked up. The only way I could play was by looking up and seeing where the platforms were then having to look down and jump blindly so I wouldn't lag, and even then I still lagged. Or maybe I just have a potato PC I don't know",
      "This would make a nice speedrunning game, and also a nice background for those text to speech tiktoks haha",
      "I don't have a clue how you got the galaxy/nebula thing to actually move, but man that was just fun to stare at.\u00a0\u00a0Agree with Keltfire, the mouse sensitivity was too high.\u00a0 Overall, though, very atmospheric.\u00a0\u00a0Nice work!",
      "Lovely environment and textures and music! Only small thing would be a way to adjust mouse sensitivity as it was way too high for me personally, but all in all very awesome!"

      "Really original idea! There are a lot of possibilities for where you can take this. As I was jumping around, I\u00a0was thinking of different hazards you could have. Like maybe the main character is like touching up old artworks, having to clean up after bugs or effects of time. Then I thought maybe this paintbrush is a forger and they're jumping around the artwork to learn its design.\u00a0 By the time I\u00a0finished playing, I\u00a0thought of Van Gogh giving the player a thumbs-up.",
      "I would love to explore more works of art in this fashion. Really interesting take on the task. I enjoyed this one a lot. I played on stream and left feedback throughout. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong, but I couldn't seem to get the full picture view to trigger. Awesome work.",
      "I love the environment, it's such a unique location, being inside the painting.",
      "Cool concept, I love starry night :)",
      "If you can make a solid gameplay loop out of this I can see this being a genius game, there's nothing to do at the moment but being able to platform through public domain art is amazing.",
      "I would really like to see future levels and gameplay, I love this concept, I think the location is super unique! I loved that the character was a paintbrush as well. I think it could be cool if you\u00a0maybe added a tiny bit of animation within the paintings, like lights turning on in windows, or clouds + stars moving, e.t.c, that would bring the paintings\u00a0 to life!",
      "Good idea showing where platforms are with colour. A unique location for sure!",
      "Really creative and beautiful game! It would be really cool and immersive with sound effects :)",
      "I'd like to see this go through, so we can see where the gameplay goes.",
      "I absolutely love the style of this game. the art is great and the way the platforms are colored and the the background is dark is really cool and creative",
      "Love the way you represent platforms using colored parts of the painting, would like to see more works of art explored in this manner",
      "",
      "Very unique concept, definitely would want to see more. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you have some ideas of how your paint brush stroke plays a role, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious to see what that would be. I liked in a way how it was somewhat ambiguous what I could jump on, I had to get an intuitive feel, which was nice.",
      "That is a really cool technique!\u00a0\u00a0I never would've thought to use a layer mask (my assumption?) as a way to create a platformer.\u00a0 Definitely going to be studying this more after the game jam and adding that to my developer toolbox.\u00a0 Nice work!",
      "I think your game is very creative and I definitely never seen anything like it. I think using a van gogh painting for the background is a great choice and love that the platforms are in different shapes"

      "Had a great time with this on stream, but wished I could earn upgrades a little more quickly. Screen wrap would be awesome too, but I think you watched my feedback already. A fun time and a perfect jam-style game. Well done.",
      "Interesting idea, I like the setting and situation you've set up with this game, although I do think it was a bit too easy/stale especially after a while. Maybe different types of enemies would help? That being said, this wasn't a gameplay round so I don't hold it against you!",
      "I love the setting and concept for this game!\u00a0I may have had some issues with my browser but I wasnt able to maximize the screen so it was it little difficult to I think get a full view for feedback. I also ran into some issues trying to make purchases. Excited to see how this develops!",
      "A fun survival game, interesting idea to have the environment change!",
      "liked the atmosphere. It reminded me of The Binding Of Isaac for some reason haha",
      "Very interesting take on the theme and the gameplay was fun. I wish there was more interactions, which is a good thing I think!",
      "I can't believe you made this in scratch! I really enjoyed the gameplay, and I loved\u00a0the location changes too.",
      "Watched this being played on Endmark Games' stream and decided to play it myself. The game was really fun! You nailed the gameplay! Awesome job!",
      "I love the little scuttle movement of the rats. I think the ability to move is awesome but I rarely moved as didn't see any benefit but a nice game nevertheless",
      "I really enjoyed this game! the sound design made hitting enemies really satisfying and the game feels super polished. the only problem is I found it too easy to just spin my mouse\u00a0in a circle and never get hit by anything",
      "great game! killing enemies was really satisfying and i liked the art. but i felt like there was not really a point to moving because staying in the center is the most strategic place because you have more time to react with the claw but\u00a0 other than that great entry :D [also i could only make it to wave 12 :)]",
      "Very fun, had me playing for quite a while. Would have loved if the camera's UI was integrated into the game (e.g. camera battery = health)",
      "Knowing it is made in Scratch - it is great work!",
      "It was fun for a bit. The transitions were really good, I kind of wish they would have been a little more than visual (at least I couldn't tell the difference). The shop was good.",
      "Having the shop at the very end was a nice lure to try again, though I found that wildly spinning my arm around like a maniac still ended up being as good a strategy as any. Would be interesting to see different enemies or mechanics occur as the sub levles changed! Or if there was a way you could make them change yourself for some benefit?",
      "The game was fun, but I felt like it got boring eventually."

      "Using the robot as platform and for movement is cool. And the background looks so beautiful! A solid game overall!",
      "Nice work all around! Far more than a level, controls felt real nice - and I highly appreciate the good design in relating the primary character colors to the text box popups. Even had a whole little story and everything. Well done!",
      "Whoua this game is not a game jam game i thing we are just play testers. Cuz that have to be released as a full game. That's impressive game mecanics, art styles everthing.",
      "Really loved this! it was awesome flying around on your robot!! Looking forward to getting to this point of gameDev one day! haha",
      "I enjoyed the different mechanics and the level design uses them well.\u00a0The graphics and animations are great, I also liked the attention to detail on the\u00a0text box. The\u00a0effects you put on some of the words are really cool.",
      "Love the variations in gameplay\u00a0with your little robot buddy, also a fan of the parallax, particles, and tiny animations like the stars. The location itself is quite cliche but a great game nonetheless.",
      "Really nice entry. The environment is interesting and the art is great. I know this isn't a gameplay round, but the gameplay is also really cool, I love using your little robot buddy to traverse different obstacles.",
      "Great game and story, I did find the space controls a bit sluggish and clunky, but since that wasn't the task I didn't let it affect the rating. My only complaint would be the fact that sometimes the text goes outside of the screen. Overall It's a great entire and I hope that you get to round 2!",
      "This was great bud.\u00a0 Very well thought out and executed.\u00a0 Loved the gravity flying mechanics primarily.\u00a0 One small item I would say is when you need your follower friend to jump onto etc is that he snaps / lerps into position faster so that the player doesn't have to wait.\u00a0 The one point I really noticed this was when he was needed to jump over the laser horizontally.",
      "Wow, I'm amazed by all the mechanics you've implemented in this short amount of time ! programming is still a kind of magic for me so that makes you... a wizard. And on top of that, art is really cool, there is a beautiful dialog system, cutscenes, juicy animations ... I'm jealous ! Very well done !",
      "I love the art, but the If I remember correctly the \"mop\" riding section is a bit slippery and I would have liked to see a unique riding animation and not just a static player, The last two things\u00a0I have to say is the shine animation on the helmet\u00a0 I don't think should be there in some parts\u00a0because if there is light it won't go away in the same room just because you move\u00a0but I guess its an artistic choice, The wall climbing is a bit finicky sometimes when it works it's great but when it does not it's a minor annoyance. The art was overall great I love the bounciness of the player the mop was cool just a little static lol,\u00a0 I would love to see more of this.",
      "great use of the robot for some cool varied mechanics. clean movement and control, very very nice gameplay.",
      "I am amazed on how many uses you found for the robot companion! Very cool!The art style is sick, well done, that shiny helmet and the way you grab on to edges is so cute! (great inclusion by the way mechanic-wise)Can't wait to see what else you make with mr Mops!I hope to hear your story of switching to gamemaker, how did that happen? :D",
      "Thanks for letting me know about this on Twitter <3 I appreciated that you had some dialogue at the start for flavour and investment but then eased off it for the actual gameplay.",
      "Great game! Very well-designed level, satisfying controls, and\u00a0just enough difficulty.",
      "Such a clean game! it feels super polished and nice, and the art is super cool. the dialogue is also really fun",
      "Thank you so much. I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some other unexplored mechanics that would work, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping we continue with this entry.",
      "love that, waiting for next part",
      "Very fun! Obviously would like to have sound but I understand leaving it out for round 1. Controls were very intuitive and smooth, and the ledge grabbing felt very satisfying.",
      "This is the first game I played in this jam\u00a0and I think it is really cool. Love the little bit of humour at the start, the art is top notch and the\u00a0way you traverse the level is awesome, especially with the other character being a handy platform that never gets in the way",
      "very fun platformer and artstyle!",
      "I feel like you used pretty simple pixel art together in a way that looks amazing and immersive, and the gameplay feels super smooth.\u00a0 It was also great to see a fellow GameMaker enthusiast!\u00a0 Hopefully I'll get to join you in the next round.\u00a0 No doubts at all that you'll be there.",
      "The helper bot's mechanics were creative. Great game!",
      "Really enjoyed this! Great mechanics and art direction. The dialogue was fun and the controls felt nice. Great job!",
      "Luved it",
      "I CANT BELIEVE YOU HYPED UP MY GAME WHEN YOU HAD THIS UNDER YOUR SLEEVE! Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to see more !!!!",
      "The juice in this game is fantastic!\u00a0 The mechanics introduced with the tiny bot character were cool, the art style was great, and those small details like the grip mechanic and the interaction with the characters, both in terms of mechanics and dialogs,\u00a0were great. Solid entry! 10/10\u00a0\u00a0Had a lot of fun playing this one!",
      "Really fun level and I already like both characters, would like to see what they do next!"

      "Your pixel art is lovely. I'm going to be studying your tree.\u00a0 That's what I was trying to do in mine!\u00a0\u00a0The gameplay is really interesting.\u00a0 A cool way to sort of teach/learn color theory.\u00a0 Took me a minute to figure out what I was supposed to be doing though.\u00a0 Not the focus of the game, though.\u00a0 Great job all around!",
      "I played this on stream and left feedback throughout my time with the entry if you didn't get a chance to watch the playback yet. I really enjoyed the art and gameplay. It was a nice comfy experience after a couple hours streaming, so it hit the spot perfect. Great work. Looking forward to see what you do next round.",
      "Such a nice little game! the art was really cute and I liked the mechanic of having to mix the ghost color and the lantern color to make the ghost happy. plus the water shader you used was really nice",
      "I really liked the concept and the art. The game did feel a little slow paced and too easy\u00a0though.",
      "I like the idea but I think it's quite simple. The gameplay felt quite slow and there wasn't much that kept you interested, but the concept is very interesting. Great job.",
      "I think you did a nice job on style, the reflection and background fit quite nicely. Walking felt a bit slow, but I still made it to the end to see the whole level (also wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite sure how I got the spirits home). Made me think of spiritfarer, fun title too.",
      "its alright. the lack of tutorial made it hard to figure out what to do but once i figured it out it was kinda cool. i like the aesthetic of the town, but the location itself imo is super generic."

      "Nicely done, loved how the 2.5D elements shone through. Fun mechanic of the coins unlocking the level, and you actually built out a pretty decently sized space here!",
      "OK, don't laugh but I thought I couldn't get the game to run because I kept thinking I had Quit selected instead of Start. Ha! It took me a bit to get everything up and running properly on my PC, but I'm so glad I did. This was a fantastic entry. There was something so exhilarating about running across an empty chasm collecting coins just in time for the blocks to appear in front of me. This was\u00a0 a really clever and beautiful platformer. Excellent work.",
      "I really liked the mechanic and the movement being a set distance of jump rather than varied was a nice retro touch that helped make the platforming feel great when you know exactly how far you'll jump.\u00a0 I think like a lot of people, I search games based on \"Windows\", but I don't think this game showed up in that way, so I didn't even realise it existed until I took off the search parameters. Maybe that's why you have so few ratings, as it isn't listed as a Windows app, and so no one can see it.",

      "I loved the starry background and lighting effects, and the art style was great! I had a bit of lag, but that doesn't really matter, that's not what this round is about lol. I loved exploring, this is a very unique location, great job :)",
      "The lighting effects are awesome. This looked really cool. I liked the under-red-glass part, too.",
      "I like the movement. feels really good. The effects are nice too! I was wondering if it would be nicer if the character stays within the grid, still moving at the same pace, but always ends movement within a square? Not sure, maybe it will work better for puzzle design elements later on :) Great visuals and interesting location",

      "Really like the location and how the different sized stars add depth and motion to the outpost. The special effects are very nice and movement is fluid. Hope I get to\u00a0explore more",

      "Why do zombies always have to ruin my chill farming sim!? Well done. Had a fun time with this one.",
      "Cool survival management game, nice job!",
      "Cool game but quite boring.",
      "This game is pretty fun! I liked having to manage both attacking and farming to stay alive, although I felt things moved\u00a0 bit too slow, , like collect crops, attack zombie, collect more crops, attack zombie again and again. It was a fun loop but when depositing crops is slow and same with growing crops going back collecting the axe and collecting them was a bit slow. but I think Its a cool concept and would love to see where it goes",
      "Funny quirky idea of a magical farm... THAT HAS ZOMBIES!",
      "",
      "I think this is a good start to a fun idea.\u00a0 Would've liked to see a bit more graphics for the jam, but I think you still are onto something cool.\u00a0 Take some of the ideas mentioned below after the jam and keep going with it!\u00a0 I'll be curious to see what you do with it.",
      "the game was great the setting itself was not that original but the story behind it makes up for it, gameplay wise the game was fun but i feel like an indicator as to where the zombies are could have been really useful",
      "I really liked your story explaining the whole situation (of course, being impatient I wished you would allow for a \"Skip-this-paragraph-I-read-it-now\" button, but this is a game jam and I know you have a million other things to worry about.",
      "By the intro lore, I was going to say it definitely sounds like an interesting location! Although sad that it seemed essentially disconnected to the actual gameplay itself. Interesting mashup though, to have a combo farm simulator / zombie rush, I can imagine future levels getting kind of hectic!"

      "Love that Ocarina of Time-style auto jump. I do wish I could jump on my own though. Those aren't part of this round's task. I think you nailed the actual task. Love the reveal of the major visual elements with their placement. The camera triggers were smooth. Great work all around. I played on stream and left feedback throughout my play if you wanted to see more. Great entry.",
      "such a cool idea!\u00a0I love the models and the way the camera moves when you get to different spots. cant wait to see where you can take this !",
      "Cool but you should make a manual jump instead of the auto jump.",
      "Really impressive character and the world is so detailed, can tell a lot went into its making. Love the fact that the character can auto jump in places and camera is really good. The feet can clip inside the stairs but its only a minor thing compared to how many more awesome things there is, well done",
      "Nailed the art/visual design challenge.\u00a0 The camera movement was a little unpredictable in places.\u00a0 But aside from that, it was great.\u00a0 Love the cracked faces in some of the pillars.",

      "I think you set a really nice atmosphere for the game and you got an awesome\u00a0environment, loving the bumpiness of the skin and all of the details in the microscopic world. The music and sound effects especially the timing of the walking are all great. My only suggestion for future improvement\u00a0is\u00a0I think the hairs might work better as a solid",
      "Very unique location! Arrow keys worked fine, but while trying to move with WASD, I couldn't move left or forward with the W and A keys. The art style is interesting and the music enjoyable. Nice work!",
      "some buttons dont work",
      "Very unique location, the art is uncanny and reminds me of Subnautica. The character move set with the dash and floaty jump suit this game very well. Unrelated to this round, but I encountered many bugs (other than lice)\u00a0that made it hard to play, I hope you will have time to fix them in future rounds and I look forward to the gameplay",
      "Interesting spooky level for sure, curious to see what comes. Being the manifestation of head-lice is definitely unique!",
      "I really love the particle effects coming out of the player, and the atmosphere of the game is great! I hope you get through to the next round because I'd love to see what the story would be like. Just saw your comment saying it was located in the human skin, that's such a unique location, probably one of the most unique ones I've seen!",
      "Great to play with you\u00a0on stream watching. Love the world you built here. I see nothing but potential and want to spend more time in this space. Great work.",
      "Love the style you went for the human skin! Nice little details with the hair, and the skin with the unsettling music and SFX!I was so happy to find the little mites walking around hehe. I always wanted to make a game on the skin, it is such a weird world!Interesting choice of camera work, to have it move around constantly! (Are you using a French keyboard? The arrow keys worked nicely but not the WASD hehe)",

      "Love the artstyle, atmosphere and gameplay! brilliant entry",
      "Super cool! I love the art style and the different methods of moving around are cool. I just think it could be a little easier to switch between them. I don't think the mouse needs to be involved. And also the foreground element inside the tent is a cool touch, but it blocks some of the platforming so it's hard to see what you're doing. It would be cool if it just wasn't in the way. But overall, really cool entry!",
      "This was amazing! Everything, the art style, the juice, the atmosphere, the spider legs especially.\u00a0 I would love to see more of this.!",
      "Loved the vibes and this spider-like mechanic ! but as many others couldn't pass the tent, even if it's possible I think it's just a pain ahah. But overall very nice experience, would play more of it !",
      "I love the art style, and the gameplay was so fun! I'm not sure if I missed something but I couldn't figure out how to swap items, and couldn't get past the tent, I'm seeing people say about mouse buttons but I am on a trackpad, so is that why? I probably just didn't read something\u00a0LMAO",
      "Awesome mechanic that caught me off guard. The legs reveal is a really strong start for a potential full game and sets the tone amazingly. The visuals are also so good. One thing, I think swapping between items would be more efficient\u00a0with keys rather than mouse buttons.",
      "This is awesome.",
      "Hello fellow GDevelopers!\u00a0LOVING the mechanics! Great game! Gameplay and art are very solid.\u00a0A little bit lag on my potato laptop but that's on my part probably lol. Gonna need to do some upgrades. Thanks for making this!",
      "this is amazing, the spider leg thing is super original and the setting i great too",

      "\"WHAAAAT?? WTFF\" that was my reaction to the mechanic I was so not expecting that, it was so weird I love it so much, and the way it moves so awkwardly, that's genius. Really awesome, can't wait to see how it's going to evolve, really well done ! And the art is so beautiful, and the ambiance sound too, I love good sound design, it really makes everything go together. Really an amazing work all around !",

      "Really great entry. Super cool art and really interesting mechanics.",
      "The environment is really nice and the ability of the character is really unique and awesome. Your game definitely leaves me wanting to see more",
      "this game was absolutely crazy. when you first pick up that item thinking \"Oh what could this be\" and then you see what it is I was confused in the best way possible same with the ending. On top of that the ambient snow blowing sound effect in the background was cool plus the actual platforming mechanics were super clean and polished",
      "Very very good game! The jumping sound is sometimes slightly buggy but it doesn't matter.",
      "This was one of the most unique entries.\u00a0 Awesome job on it.\u00a0 Total was a feature having to toggle spider in the tent :)",
      "one of the best entries of this jam, it was so good that I want to give some feedback :)1. music. I imagine my enjoyability of this game would double if there was some music2. collision mask. some times character is staying in emptiness (as there is a floor)3. i would add some plot. maybe even some horror things. but I know you didnt have enough timeOverall, I love it 10/10",
      "Parsdon my French, but heck this was freakin' good! I had a blast playing this on stream and left a lot of feedback during the playthrough if you didn't watch the playback yet.Love the atmosphere, the unique character, movement and conclusion. Only real complaint/feedback would be to tie the inventory equip/unequip to a key press so I don't have to pause the action. Excellent entry.",
      "One of my favourite entries so far, I LOVED the atmosphere that you managed to make, but I did find the controls a bit awkward.",
      "I love this,I\u00a0 \u00a0just wish the leg mechanic was a bit less finicky along with the collision, other than that I love the paper mario like turn and the elasticity of the character, 1 suggestion you should add the option of using the spacebar to jump I often found myself going to the\u00a0 spacebar to jump lol, ohh 1 more thing having to shift then press the thing to unequip multiple times was a bit much maybe add a unequip and a equip last button?",
      "That was really neat! I think, if continued with as a larger project,\u00a0it could be expanded with more abilities, like I was thinking \"Claymates\" from SNES\u00a0while I played it. The one ability in this was really unique how it was done and how it looked, so if you added more abilities, it'd be cool to see more mechanics that are as unique as shown in this one.",
      "Cool level and I loved the neat legs mechanic."

      "Played on stream tonight and left my comments throughout if you want to watch the playback. It appeared so simple at first, but I love the slow reveal and careful placement of elements. Really well done.",
      "Wow, love the harsh total contrast. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing how much we can get a sense of the space with so little details, and shapes of objects (though also makes it easy to get lost and fall off if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like me and intentionally wander). The reveal of the last moment after getting the flower was just such perfect composition, what a good touch. Definitely want to see more of this :+1: reminds me of video game that was about painting and coloring the world, where you started out all white and unshaded like this. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember the name at all but if you come across it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you could build more on the ideas it was playing with. This is very ripe for some good storytelling.",
      "Excellent idea of having foreground and background elements be the same white color, reminds me of The Unfinished Swan. The level design is also excellent with the intentional slow revealing of new content.",
      "So poignant. A beautiful art piece with such depth for such a simple layout",
      "I love this art style, I think you've done great for your first 3d game! Now I'm really curious to see\u00a0how the rest of the story unfolds.",
      "A really interesting start.",
      "Beautiful path to walk along, even though it's only black and white I feel like you've added so much depth and detail to the scene. Loved it!",
      "Love the style of the game and the use of white is really good, especially felt good going over the hill and exploring the path",
      "Soooo elegant. Chef's kiss!",
      "It's a very creative story.",
      "love the simplicity but would like a bit of sound. but overall, noice",
      "Very unique, adding sounds or music would have helped me get into it a bit more but I love it anyway. I like the fact that we cant see the tree, only their silouhette, it's was really poetic. Well done !",
      "I really like the simplicity and style of this. Even more so, I like that it all tells a story.",
      "I love the art style! It kind of reminds me of the first few levels of the unfinished swan with white and black objects revealing each other. the game could use sound effects and I did feel the movement was a tad slow",
      "Cool concept.\u00a0 The story really leaves me wanting more.\u00a0 Kind of reminds me of Beyond Eyes\u00a0(without the terribly slow movement issues).\u00a0 Nice work!"

      "Had a blast with this one on stream and was so glad you could join me. Love all the effects and visuals and it ran incredibly well for an HTML build on stream on a Mac. Great stuff all around. Can't wait to see what you make next.",
      "Really amazing aesthetic! The atmosphere is great and I liked the narration. The colors are ethereal and convey a sense of wonder.\u00a0Great work!",
      "Very gorgeous atmosphere, and I like the narration too! Excited to see where you take this.",
      "Oh this is amazing, reminds me of Jungle Cruise at disneyland or something of the sort!",
      "Very beautiful and unique location for sure ! I'm curious to leran more about this place... well done !",
      "Is a really great game! I love the atmosphere!",
      "Visually stunning!",
      "Really pretty game! I agree with the others that the aesthetic is very pretty! I\u00a0also think that the UI pulls the player out of the game some. Also, I am not sure if other people experienced this, but the game had major performance issues for me. Could be because it is in browser, or I have several things open, or something. It is worth looking into though, as you continue to build and develop this game. Great job!! :D",
      "Unique and beautiful, this concept could pass of as a walking simulator game on its own. One nitpick would be that the UI boxes pull the player out of immersion, I would recommend using diegetic/spatial UI instead, or use simple subtitles like this:",
      "I...I don't even know what to say.\u00a0\u00a0This was just stunning.\u00a0 A few collider issues.\u00a0 But you nailed the aesthetic.\u00a0 I'm gonna be studying this one for a LONG time after the game jam is over.\u00a0 Great work!",
      "Wow, this is so stunning! The location is really unique, and I am curious to see how the story and gameplay would look in the future!",
      "This is a really beautiful level, with lovely lighting and models!",
      "Such an awesome game! Visually stunning with lots of cool effects and models, and I loved the touch of the narration explaining elements of the world. top Notch",
      "This is beautiful,\u00a0I love the word,\u00a0 and I am vary\u00a0Intrigued to see what this would be like in a full game. I also love when game have voice acting great touch!",
      "The world you made is awesome and I really like that you are giving details about things as I'm moving around such a beautiful place that I want to explore",
      "The aesthetic does it for me. Loved seeing the world you've created.\u00a0Great job!",
      "Quite a large feyworld you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created here! I guess my browser isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite beefy enough for the fullscreen experience, but looking very nice at the default size. Clearly put a lot of thought into the kore and surprisingly a large number of different feeling areas, could have easily felt too \u00e2\u0080\u009csamey\u00e2\u0080\u009d, nice work.",
      "Cool environment. I liked the use of fog and particles and color to make it feel very \"other worldly\". The voice overs are also a nice touch and contribute to the atmosphere.Nice entry!",
      "This was so good. Im a sucker for this kind of aesthetic. That coupled with the postition triggered voice overs was really cool! My mac was struggling to play it in the browser but besides that everything was very cool!",
      "This is an incredible entry for the jam. Incredibly polished, visually astonishing, and definitely a 100/10. Nice work!!"

      "Fun bullet hell navigation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now you make the very clear patterns and create some interesting scenarios where you need to be in a certain place on screen to shoot forward yet are blocked and so forth. Nice level.",
      "Streamed while playing this and commented throughout if you want to watch the playback. It's clear how much thought and attention you put into each enemies movement, look and bullet pattern. With a controller, I could easily see myself getting addicted to this one. Well done!",
      "This is amazing. Great art. Great level design.",
      "Very good! The map looks ok but it's very challenging, which is a good thing.",
      "This is sooo good. Love the different movement and attack patterns of the enemies and how varied they are. The last boss took a lot longer to kill than I expected. I like the message at the end too. I don't think I would have got that far if I didn't get stuck in a root. I think if the player is off the screen, it should be game over.\u00a0On a normal playthrough, I had a lot of fun and love all of the visual elements, animations\u00a0and how you have to walk around obstacles as well as dodge bullets. This is one of my favorites.",
      "Great art direction.",
      "really loved the style. the gameplay was extremely hectic but fun to weave through massive waves of bullets.",
      "Love the baked art style, with the bright red bullets, it adds a lot to readability. The environment being hard for the player was also a nice touch, while the enemies just went through.",
      "Creepy! But I'm sure that this is what you were going for, so well done!"

      "Nice work, i love the art style. The mouse control is the only problem for this entry. I like it.",
      "Really bummed I couldn't get this to work out on stream because this is an excellent entry. I love the feel of the dash, and while it took me a bit to get into the boat without falling in the water, I had fun cruising around and I'm glad you included it. All of the dialogue was enjoyable to read and I like the layers of terrain giving the space an organic feel.\u00a0Great entry.",
      "Nice game",
      "Love the game concept, I saw a devlog and liked it straight away. I see someone else noticed that the dash 'breaks the game', but they say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an easter egg. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective I guess :^)",
      "Very cool looking game.",
      "This was absolutely breathtaking.\u00a0 Reminded me of the aesthetic from old Might and Magic games, but better.\u00a0 And I'm definitely hooked on the storyline.\u00a0\u00a0I want to know more!\u00a0 Great job!",
      "Amazing artsyle.\u00a0love the dash effect. Location is unique. What else to ask for?",
      "Such an awesome style! I love the style of the game and the npc dialogue is cool.",
      "Ah I remember you working on this on discord! Really solid how it turned out. I caught onto the shift-fly mode and found the little temple room across the water, always appreciate a good easter egg for those that explore. The fade out to the background and overall aesthetic works really nicely.",
      "The aesthetic was very nice, although I had trouble with the mouse on the browser version.",
      "The environment you made is seriously good from every angle, even the sky and the portal that drops you down when going in the water. Enjoyed walking around the island and testing out the dash ability",
      "Didn't expect this to run on HTML, yet had ablasttalking toflamb\u00c3\u00a9 skelly bois",
      "Really gorgeous lighting and really nice atmosphere to it all, awesome work!",
      "Very beautifully stylized, love the dash. Remember to lock the players cursor in the browser version! Looking forward to see how you develop this",
      "Awesome entry, I\u00a0really love the aesthetic! I could totally see this as the baseline for a horror game or some kind of action/stealth game where you need to collect souls. Not sure if this was intended but I noticed while dashing, I wasn't falling so I could be floating really high up. If that's intended, I can't wait to see how that mechanic might be used!",

I do have to say though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit awkward trying to wrangle such keys, though maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the challenge to build up some completely new kind of muscle memory.

I'd have liked it if the animals didn't scurry away until I hit a prompt (I'm sad I missed the monkey). Level layout was immaculate. It all felt like it was free-flowing, but you put the player on a deliberate path that was satisfying. Top marks. Really well done.",
      "This is a really cool concept for a game, its a fun twist on the standard metroidvania style. I also love the artwork, its amazing. great job :D",
      "I really enjoyed the game! It was short, but sweet. My only complaint would be that I wish the buttons were located more conveniently.",
      "Such cool mechanics that fit the spirit of the forest theme! perfect artwork and sound design also. Great!",
      "I loved your gameplay. I had to figure out how to use each animal skill but once we understand it just makes sense. Also very simple but well thought level design, I think it's a great proof of concept ! Well done !"

      "I beat level 1! I feel like I cheated a bit using the solid red walls to bite and launch haha :)I like this game. Inside the body is definitely a unique environment, lots of room to take this further for sure, and I would definitely be interested in playing more levels. As for constructive feedback, If you want to take this forward I think you could definitely look into what kind of visual juice you can add around background textures/layers, particles (especially things like fluids etc), camera stuff, etc.I know this isn't a gameplay round, but I did enjoy the mechanics, it was difficult but not super frustrating, I think you got a good balance which can be difficult in a gamejam.Great entry! And congrats on your first solo jam!",

      "The movement in this game was VERY FUN and VERY REWARDING to get the hang of. I'd love to see more levels and the location is super unique and interesting to me. I definitely see a lot of potential in a fully realised game where a parasite uses various means to travel around different parts of a host's body. Very fun gem. If I were to add any constructive feedback, perhaps the visual design (textures, vfx, etc.) could be more \"fleshed out\" (pun intended) to really sell the unique level location."

Wow!Playing it on fullscreen led to one slight move of the mouse turning the camera to the sky, but all was a lot better at the window mode.Tried to jump on the big tower balcony for fun, couldn't reach it, but noticed it was hovering a few meters from the ground.

      "I got to say I love it\u00a0 there were only 2 things I saw when you shake the house thing you can see a black line of pixels on the sprite for a second and the second thing is really nothing but I would like to be able to go behind the building along with that maybe make them semi-transparent when walking behind, but other then that nothing bad I love the art I love the sound I love the footsteps only with the keys were a bit bigger because at first idk what they where. anyways good job",
      "When standing on the top of the mountain, the screen is half the sky and half the snow, with the snowflakes flying in the sky, you just exhale. Then I know this is the right game. Awosome work.",
      "Very beautiful game in a great location.",
      "Obviously the art is exceptional. Level design is also so good. It felt like it continued to open up as I learned what I could and could not traverse, even through the level itself wasn't changing. Great design work",
      "Holy frick is that some good art.\u00a0 Loved the look of the game",
      "Loved it, artstyle, music, overall vibe... I would even have removed the little gameplay for more art\u00a0 like parallax in the background to enjoy even more this atmosphere ! Well done !",
      "While the girl was \"enjoying the breathe\" I enjoyed awesome art! I imagine this game being in detective or criminal genre xD. Hope to see more levels and full game. 10/10",
      "Gorgeous game, and I love details like the snow prints. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Definitely a unique location!",
      "Absolutely beautiful art design, I want to see more of this one!",
      "This looks so good. Great pallete, great pace, a lot of small details that add A LOT to the feel. I really liked this one.",
      "Such beautiful artwork as always, spoonsweet <3 really nice environment and attention to detail with the footprints in the snow and the metal scrap noises. Great work!",
      "Such a cute little character in a game with so much polish. I really appreciate small details like the character outline still being visible when they are behind an object. Full marks from me!",
      "This is so pretty, and it has so many small little details, I really love that clang thing when you walk into the bars!",
      "This is a total vibe",
      "really amazing art. I love the little effects like the snow and the footprints",
      "Adorable art and effects. Love the little footprints in the snow! Level looks great and makes me want to explore it. Great work!",
      "Really nice, love all of the details in the level and things like having the outline of the character when behind a building is perfect",
      "Magic, so beautiful and calming, such a great ambiance, really well done !",
      "Great job spoon, you never stop amazing me!",
      "Wow this is brilliant! Really pretty, got a very calming essence to it, this is 100% making it to round 2",
      "what a spectacular piece of art. Very cozy feeling.",
      "Nice art. really great game.",
      "Top marks. I think you know from the stream playback, I loved this entry. Really well done, spoonsweet. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us next.",
      "Um.. I\u00a0think this is the first game I've ever fully gave 5 stars on everything... Just awesome.",
      "Very beautiful and quaint, nice work. The little ambient sounds are subtle but very nice. I like how sentiments are displayed in the world as you get near them, adds some nice character. And the character avatar is so cute!"

      "Great work! As many comments noticed the mechanic was a bit hard to pull of, great idea though! The music and art (as well as story with the koi fish) are sweet!One suggestion would be to not have Ctrl + WASD, as my browser closed the tab many times when I pressed Ctr+W...",
      "Very cute game and very aesthetic! The sound and visuals are sooo good! I couldn't get past the first jump in the game unfortunately, but what I did see was very pretty! I\u00a0am sure the rest of the game was lovely! The music was very relaxing! Great job! :DI just accidentally got past the first obstacle. Woo! Time to try the game out for real lol.\u00a0Nvm. I\u00a0got stuck. lol! Still really cool game!",
      "Visually it looks great and sounds beautiful!\u00a0 I\u00a0love the Story about the Koi turning into a Dragon, it adds a great story building element to help explain the very difficult\u00a0player controls. Your Games Web Page is wonderful put together.\u00a0 I\u00a0just relaxed in this game for like 10 mins - TY for making this :)",
      "I had some trouble with the controls, but I really love the art style and ambience of the game! The inspiration and story behind the game is really unique, and I am looking forward to seeing where you take this.",
      "This was really cool! The music and the art style worked extremely well together. The controls were hard, I managed to get a little far but ended up getting stuck in a wall and having to restart. But the times I did manage to advance felt really satisfying. I would love to see this game in Its full form, so please, don't leave it behind and give us a new release!",
      "Great looking level! Nice particles and feel. I couldn't see much as I kept getting stuck on walls and got too frustrated to continue. Controls were hard to use but that doesn't matter as it is ranked on the level design, not mechanics :)",
      "Game looks great and I know what to do but the controls make it too hard unfortunately.\u00a0Shame. I'd like to see more though, I'm sure you can improve the control scheme in later rounds!",
      "The simple effect of the snow(dust)\u00a0 make the scene a better level.",
      "Very cool looking. I was not not good enough to get used to the control mechanics and it took me a while.",
      "I LOVE THE ART :DThe level is actually pretty cool lookin, and the music's pretty good too.Overall, a pretty epic concept and cool art.\u00a0Would love to see more levels btw :)",
      "I like the story and the music is very relaxing. It took me some time to figure out what to do inthis roomsince the water at the top was a bit hard to distinguish from the background.\u00a0I'm looking forward to playing the version with 100 rooms!",
      "the game seems to be really nice and the artwork is great but the controls are really janky and make te game really hard to play",
      "Really fun gameplay mechanic, I\u00a0think there's some small tweaks needed to the sensitivity of movement and control input but all in all very fun and a beautiful environment!",
      "I think this game looks really nice and love the whole story about it but I seem to get stuck in the first wall every time I try to get over it with the bubble dash",
      "amazing visuals and interesting gameplay. great job.",
      "good job!",
      "Very appealing visuals and a well-designed level. Moving around is a bit difficult as others already mentioned but it shouldn't matter that much in this round.",
      "The setting is nice and calming, love the inspiration behind the game",
      "The art style and particles look great but since I don't have a controller I found it very hard to play. I couldn't really get the hang of the controls.",
      "Stupidly easy to clip through walls, however I think the art and the theme is quite sweet :)",
      "Pretty world, nice palette. Controls (which is not what this round is being rated on, so no probs!) are a little awkward having to use the mouse and trying to wrangle the bubble at the same time, but can see that as an interesting mechanic.",
      "Nice game with good music and atmosphere. The controls are hard to use. But still a great game.",
      "Loved this. Would be among my favorite entries if the movement was working as you intended, but hey, that's not part of this round, so top marks from me. You can tell how thoughtfully you designed each challenge. Really well done.",
      "Had an issue with the obstacle / jump in the beginning but despite that I think you nailed the prompt.\u00a0 Great colors and environment, looking forward to seeing future versions of it.",
      "Super interesting mechanic! My favorite part of this game is easily the colors and tilemap! Can never go wrong with some pink and green :p Excited to see what comes next",
      "I love this color palette. The ground terrain sprites, and the leaves are really well done. The waterfalls look great as well. Combined with the particles (Sakura leaves?) and music it builds a very contemplative space, which it sounds like you were going for."

      "I liked the art a lot. It reminded me of stickers, or like Paper Mario, really cool style. And I like the user bar actions at the bottom of the screen, reminds me of old PC games.",
      "Played on stream and left feedback throughout my play session if you want to watch. Love the concept and would be really interested to see you keep building on this. Great work.",
      "I read the description of the game and it sounds like this is going to be awesome, it's already looking good btw. Love all of the ideas you have for it and the art is looking great. One thing I think would be beneficial is if you can hold a button down to keep moving a tile every second rather than having to keep pressing",
      "Right now the level is very unique but I don't see a bigger idea of how you could make the game fun and challenging. But maybe you know how to make it more fun.",
      "I really enjoyed the art, it was super vibrant and colorful!",
      "I identify with the running out of time! That being said, thankfully the challenge is to create an interesting level/location, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say this hits the mark. Fun use of colors, without it feeling overly saturated/eye sore. I do hope to see some martian potato growing in the next update :D",
      "I think the location is incredibly unique, but because no gameplay its kinda hard to critique."

      "this game made me smile))) good job, would like to see diverse of controls",
      "A good start! The character art is unique and the puzzle is pretty classic! As others have mentioned a zoom out or some other way to know which pipe I'm affecting would be great. Nice job!",
      "A very classic puzzle, that's what I love.",
      "Loved it! Unique location!! I'd love to see why your character is their in the first place? and what the story is!",
      "I love this concept, and it is a puzzle game that I would love to keep playing! I agree with what the others are saying, to fix the scaling a bit of the art, but I do like the style, it's really unique, and thats so cool how you converted pixel art to vector i didn't even know that was possible LMAO",
      "The art style and level design are nice, but the location can be a tad generic. If you wish to develop this further, it is important in these kinds of puzzle games to show which valve affects which pipe, possibly by color or small pipes connecting them. You can also zoom out so the player can see more of the level at once.",
      "I think the game definitely has potential, like the artstyle, which looks really nice except for some parts where you scaled the objects differently and it looks a bit off. The puzzle in the level\u00a0is quite simple, but the mechanic of turning on and off water flow could have potential if used in harmony with other puzzle mechanics.",
      "whoa hand drawn! nice! simple puzzles",
      "I always enjoy the personality of your characters! This smile beneath the beard hides a lot... I don't know if I should be scared.",
      "This was a pretty cool game! the puzzles were simple but I enjoyed them, It will be cool to see what more could be done with the mechanics. Plus the art is really nice.",
      "The art is great, this first level showcases how the puzzles will be solved in an easy to understand way and I like how you have ladders to make the movement more interesting, but I do wish for a jump button. I'm sure future levels will have more challenges but the concept is great so far",
      "But now that the water has stopped.... what happens to the pipes??? these questions need answering FennecFu.",
      "Interesting color palette, fun rounded shapes. The level created feels a bit generic, but did at least include one switchback, a staple of puzzle design."

      "Digging the vibe, cohesive visuals and spatial audio. I wish the enemies in the training room would have worked out(looked cool in the devlog). Keep up the great work, hope you make it to the next round!",
      "Love this and the dialogue you have with the NPCs!!",
      "Ah man, I\u00a0was so convinced you donk'd up the audio with it only playing in my right headphone when I started playing! Then I started moving, the music filled out, and the level came together from there! Really enjoyed the music and the neon aesthetic! Great work!",
      "Played on stream and I'm glad I did. I needed that dance break and I'm glad you got to watch the feedback. This is such a, as you put it, \"fever dream.\" It works really well though and I could see myself loving bouncing between relaxing with my agent buddies between sessions of intense missions. Great entry. Loved it.",
      "I\u00a0really like the palette and simple pixel art. Looking forward to see where this goes from here.\u00a0Now that song is suck in my head.",
      "The music is banging, such a vibe place",
      "Everything about this is right up my alley.\u00a0\u00a0The bright, flashy aesthetic.\u00a0 The humor.\u00a0 SWEET RAVE PARTY!\u00a0 The whole thing.\u00a0 I really have no real critiques aside from not having more of the game.\u00a0 I need more of the game!",
      "This was amazing! The music is what makes it, such a good track that you can't help but bop to and I was smiling and saying \"yes!!!\" the whole time playing lol.\u00a0 Love the idea of partying agents, kind of silly, fun, awesome tracks to listen to. And the shooting mechanic was fun and easy to see how it could be used in the future. I want to see more!",
      "I have nothing to critic, everything fits perfectly, also I want to thank you for introducing me to the good music artist, been playing it on the loop now XD",
      "Everything about this is great and I want more of it.",
      "love the environment and the humor! my only problem was the music from the RAVE ROOM (which was great) was blasting into only one ear until i got close, so i was basically deaf for the first half of the game lol",
      "stereo *5D* music effect is cool!!",
      "I really like the environment concept here with the starstuff or asteroids etc flying along in the background. A good feeling of momentum and atmosphere. Lots of great visual juice (Musics good too). Nice job!",
      "The colors. Vivid.",
      "The music was so..... dope! This game is simply FUN!! Loved it : )",
      "Great music, was vibing the whole time. Really cool environment idea and im\u00a0interested in what the it would be like with more gameplay",
      "Really awesome environment, would love to see what this turns into if you keep working on it for future rounds! Especially curious what kind of gameplay you'd have in mind for this.",
      "Great art style, love the dialogue between the characters\u00a0especially the guy on the toilet lol\u00a0and the way you shoot in the\u00a0combat training room is awesome",
      "i love this so so much! the art style is nice and i think your concept is really unique. i also loved the animations on the speaker/radio things that was cool",
      "super fun to explore and talk to the npcs. Liked the sponge bob reference that was cool, plus the music was an absolute blast and the art was on point"

Could be similar kind of thing, like if the powerup is on \"G\" that a skeleton is on and you use the G, then you get a double damage for that letter.",

      "You know I got that cheddar! Love the unique controls and I had a really fun time playing this on stream. Thanks for sharing your work.",
      "Interesting game here. This game is giving me a Hotline Miami vibes, leaving behind all of the corpses. It felt weird to me that I\u00a0had to stop moving to turn, but yet I can easily spin the gun around and shoot in all directions.",
      "Unique gameplay with just the mouse! Story and location are quite funny too. Nice job",
      "This was fun! The idea of controlling the mouse only with your mouse was a really cool concept. Although I Got promised cheese in the title and didn't see anything at the end\u00a0\u00a0:(Nice game!",
      "Uh, wow. Incredible game. Very good!",
      "lol mousception",
      "I love the art style, and the\u00a0story is so great!",
      "Pretty cool. Feels a lot like endoparasitic. I like the \"mouse-only\" controls (not sure if thats intended or not), but\u00a0the mouse should be faster. Also wheres the cheese?\u00a0 think there should be more cheese lying around or something, since its supposed to be a cheese museum.",
      "Brilliant top-down zombie shooter. The ending text got me lol Awesome job, man!",
      "This is brilliant! I love that the character is a mouse that can control the arm. It's so satisfying to shoot the gun",
      "Great short and to the point introduction of the story, preparing for the comical elements that will follow (as if the name was not a give-away :D )I especially appreciated the starting area being a corridor I had to get familiar with the movement before I could move. While I do understand people's slight frustration with the movement system, after playing through it all I have to say, I now view it as an advantage for your translation between species communication: as a human I can move the human arm with great precision, yet cannot easily walk a mile on a mouse's shoes. That said, I agree with comments about the speed, perhaps having an acceleration added, that picks up speed would allow greater movement through the long corridors. Needless to say, I tried moving with the gun's recoil (beautifully animated and coded by the way, with SFX for shots, and reloading etc.) to some success.",
      "The text when the mouse got the arm xD Loved the funny texts all along, great atmosphere (just missing music, but that's me and my sound design love) Well done !",
      "Awesome game. I love how\u00a0comically large and powerful the gun feels when it's juxtaposed against the mouse. I also love the use of the mouse to move a mouse, though perhaps accessibility options could have been nice for people who use trackpad.",
      "The game is good, and I believe you are inspired by Miziziziz's Endoparasitic. The way the gory art style when humans are dying and the way the controls feel (if it is better) feels quite similar. I like the level, but I wish you can make the barriers to be a bit more precise. For example, from your second and third examples, those small boxes are one giant wall, but it feels like the player can squeeze through that gap. But the realization hits and apparently it isn't.",
      "I have to say, the concept is VERY EPIC! I love the atmosphere and the game is honestly kinda fun :D",
      "Yeah the controls got in the way for me, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play on my laptop [no middle mouse button to press] (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try again later once I boot up my pc for the other non web entries review). But from what I recall seeing on discord, definitely seems like a fun and very unique concept.",
      "Controls were hard to get the hang of, but it's cool that you can move by firing the gun.This is definitely an entry that I'd like to see more of.",
      "Fun concept.\u00a0 Like others said, controls are a little odd.\u00a0 Maybe ASDW to move/mouse to aim and shoot?\u00a0 Just brainstorming.\u00a0 All around, I like the idea and would be curious so see it in a full game.",
      "Very cool, loved the Miziziziz inspiration, mouse rotates pretty slow though.",
      "the atmosphere was very cool. The control scheme was a bit weird at first but I got used to it. I kind of didn't like how slow the player rotated but I did like the location.",
      "Finally got there, and now that I could actually use a mouse (to control the mouse ha) it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fun! I kind of like the way it forces you to choose between movement, turning, and shooting. I always appreciate trackpad-eligible controls and other cross platform ways to play, I suppose you could map to arrow keys for right/left/press both to move forward and it could be about equivalent, but all in fun entry.",
      "I am in love with your shooting mechanics and aesthetics, good job!",
      "Awesome and impressive!"

      "so well thought out in level design details! the reflection helping when it gets foggy, the simple jump and dive controls, the sfx and art.. very clean game",
      "Amazing usage of the world blending in with the mechanics, the hearts appearing after the first hit, the SFX and VFX, the fog slowly leading you to use the reflection \u00a0more and more... genius! Really enjoyed this experience! Can't wait to see more!",
      "This is just stunning, the art is beautiful, and it's a very relaxing game to play! :)",
      "This looks spectacular, it's awesome that the character is literally running on water and I imagine the roll would be great for smashing something",
      "Gorgeous art and effects! Very calming SFX and music, and the reflection mechanic with the clouds added a nice challenge! Great work!",
      "Amazing, the art style and lake reflections work very well together. The tutorial was clear and the gameplay was pretty unique. Sometimes it was confusing where to roll to though. Great job",
      "Awesome!",
      "this game is truly amazing and unique, the art style is really great and gives an unique\u00a0mood to the overall game,\u00a0 really like the idea of the fog, and having to use the salt mirror to see, its truly somthing i have never seen before, controls also feel great. The tutorial is simplistic but really clear, but an indication as to when and how to roll down would also have been good",

I\u00a0always appreciate when\u00a0people add that extra\u00a0level\u00a0of\u00a0polish and\u00a0juice to jam games like the\u00a0audio queues for the\u00a0title card and\u00a0the\u00a0particles.\u00a0Nice\u00a0Work.",

      "Really cool game! The aesthetic and atmosphere is so pretty!\u00a0I found jumping to be a bit annoying either due to the game running slowly or the way the mechanics felt. The music is very calming and fits the artistic style you are going for! Great job!",
      "Very visually beautiful and I like how the\u00a0reflection isn't just there for aesthetics, but also serves a purpose of showing you what's coming up when there's smoke in the way. I love the little character's animation too.",
      "Cool stuff.",
      "OOOHHH BOI IDK WHAT TO SAY FOR THIS!",
      "Really dope game and I love the dust that appears after running for some time. The assets you chose fit perfectly together. Also that water shader doe!",

      "Whoua that's a beautiful game",
      "",

The location is also quite unite, looking at satellite images\u00a0I always assumed it was snow!"

      "Incredible. I loved so much about this and I'm not usually a bit puzzle guy. The controls were so fluid and the polish was off the charts. I played on stream and left feedback throughout my play session if you wanted to watch. I'm incredibly impressed and look forward to your next submission.",
      "This was a fun unique level.",
      "So polished! The location itself is not amazingly unique, but the amazing upgrade area, the IK on the legs, the sounds, the puzzles,... It's a really well done game! Technically brilliant",
      "This is probably on of the most, if not the most thought out level in this whole jam.Like minedblowing honestly. THE IK animationzzz were SOOO epic :D love the spidey robot guy. AND BOI, the way the gun thingy rotates and moves is just*cheif's kiss*.Honestly can't think of any bad thing to say lol.",
      "The character is amazing and love the artwork for the level",
      "I think I saw a picture or video of this early on in the jam.\u00a0 Maybe on Twitter?\u00a0 But man, it is on a whole other level than I expected.\u00a0\u00a0There is so much attention to detail in this.\u00a0 A few bugs\u00a0(which others have mentioned) and the puzzles leave you stuck sometimes.\u00a0 But for a 2 weeks game jam, I'm incredibly impressed.\u00a0 Will definitely be studying this one more once the jam is over.\u00a0\u00a0Great work!",
      "That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next level! This game is so well made. Good job! 5/5",
      "This is amazing. I love the art style and the animations were really good. The concept is both unique and fun. There were a few glitches with the IK.\u00a0Overall, amazing job.",
      "Insanely well polished. Great IK animations, love the aim assist, there are excess gears so that the player doesn't need to get them all to complete the game, and the whole concept of the rotating environment is unique and well explored. Full marks from me!",
      "Oh yeah, like others I really enjoyed the animations in this. Even more than the player character's animations I\u00a0really liked the projectiles swirling in the orbs once they're activated.",
      "The player's animations really did this for me. I also really love that the ship is interactive.",
      "This game is insane. Such Incredible art, sound design, game design. Its basically a full game which is insane. Its one of if not the best game I've played so far"

      "Looks good, feels good. 5 stars.",
      "Adorable character and location! Really like the particle effects and animations, great work!",
      "Great world you've built, disturbing meat-world seems juicy! The effects add a lot and blend nicely with your art!",
      "the game looks so good and i cant wait for more gameplay",
      "Awesome art style. The moving mountains make this look like somewhere inside a ship floating on water or a giant breathing monster and hence all that meat. Regardless of what it is, this is some cool stuff. Good job.",
      "An extremely polished game for a game jam. The art is amazing and the sound effects are really good. The only downside is there isn't more.",
      "Nice controls and art style, I can't wait to see more.",

      "A very juicy game. The spring animation is so fluid!\u00a0Great\u00a0work!!",
      "I love all of the particles and animations, and I think this is quite a funny and unique location!",
      "Very cute entry, love the animations and sound effects! If you have extra time and plan to continue working on this, I think it'd be neat if you could drop down from the platforms, such as by pressing the down arrow or something like that.",
      "Really nice artwork and I love the swinging platforms, portals and springs",
      "the art is super good! I love the squash and stretch it really makes the game feel polished. plus the sfxs are nice",
      "sound design could use some work but the overall game feel and look is really nice and polished",
      "Really fun to play!! looking forward to seeing what you add to this!!",
      "I'll repeat what I said when I streamed this ... please give me an open room with a meatball so I can bounce away to my heart's content! Great work, Spacespy. An excellent entry."

      "My personal favorite of the jam. It's brilliance wasn't fully apparent until literally when it ended. Man I want to play more, and in a windows build so it has better performance.\u00a0How did you make a metroidvania in such a short time?\u00a0Full 5 stars.",
      "I had so much fun with this on stream. Both playing and analyzing it. Excellent work. Looking forward to what you make next.",
      "This is a really interesting and unique environment, very fun place to explore. What a fun\u00a0 entry! I love the postit notes and marker pens and other flourishes that really sell this space.",
      "One of the more unique locations that I have come across so far. I really feel like you can go far with this idea. This is the type of game where you can get away with simple hand drawn art instead of blocking out the level like you did. The character art is perfect, why not do this for all aspects of the game? How about adding some in some other colors each with their own effect? How can you incorporate the sticky notes, magnets, and other items in to the gameplay?",
      "great little platformer, would love to see more with this idea",
      "Well Done!",
      "Great game. Hope you make it through to round 2 so we can see more.",
      "this is like if you mix fancy pants, vex 4, and big tower tiny square with white boards. i love it realy want to see more of this game!",
      "Metroidvanias and platformers are where I plan on focusing in the future.\u00a0\u00a0So I always like to take note of good ones.\u00a0 And this definitely is a good one.\u00a0 The few suggestions I have are things you already made note of or have been mentioned already.\u00a0 Really good entry.\u00a0 Looking forward to seeing this take shape.",
      "This is really good, love the location and the movement in it as well as the effects from the lightning and artwork around the level. There were a few places I fell out of the whiteboard and felt it was unfair to die\u00a0walking into the side of the crushing bits. It was super fun to play though and loved to explore all of the areas and I got to the end. Look forward to more levels with the dash ability in it",
      "I love this art style ! The location is super unique and I love the little touches like the blue tack, markers, sticky notes, and magnets on the board",
      "Looks like such a good game, a shame that it won't run for me, instead glitches out and says something or rather on my browser is out of date, it isn't, however when I went to go play something else developed in construct it showed the exact same thing, despite me playing games made in construct before yours, there's clearly something wrong there.",

      "Nice styling on the environment, reminds me of Antichamber especially with the\u00a0chromatic aberration. As others have mentioned, the pace of the game is way too slow to start, I can see this with twice the firerate and still having good progression through upgrades. The location is also rather cliche, but it is a great juicy game nonetheless.",

Though maybe a little too slow paced lofting in space (at least for the price reward for upgrading).",

      "Super interesting indeed. I think you could come up with a less awkward way of selecting or changing what element is getting the jump power, felt kind of awkward, but the nugget of the idea is gold for sure, looking forward to seeing more.",

      "Short and sweet. I had fun with this one on stream and left feedback throughout. It controlled well and was a blast to play. Great work.",
      "Huh not unique",
      "Art-style, location and gameplay isn't anything unique, but surprisingly I found myself continually replaying the game! The movement mechanics were just so intuitive and felt .. right.\u00a0 Compared to a lot of platformers i've been playing on here, this was actually the tightest and easiest to control. Good job on that front! reminds me of the old school flash game platformers",
      "remembered the times when i started with these kinds of games, keep going good job",
      "The character is awesome, I can see wisdom in its eyes.",
      "The controls were well done, the character was easy to control.",
      "I love this game so much. Thank you for submitting this!",
      "Good platforming mechanics.\u00a0 Would've like a bit more visually.\u00a0 But it feels very nice.\u00a0 Good job!",
      "The platformer mechanics were nice and I liked how smooth it felt to play. I think there could have been some more variety in the level like background or different hazards just to spice things up",
      "It would have been nice to have a bit more content with\u00a0more platforms and detail in the scenery. The movement is smooth like butter though.\u00a0Good job, it feels satisfying to play.",
      "It's cool that you are trying out Construct 3! The level is well implemented, though I\u00a0would have loved if you had more detail in your art like you have in your older games.",
      "Controls are very smooth and reactive, but the levels lack some depth and detail to them. I think you have a decent start but it's missing some flavor to it.",
      "The double jump is really well implemented and fits the design of the level really well"

      "Love the music queue haha. As others have pointed out, I had some minor issues with the rope grabbing, but that's not super relevant to round 1. I did finish, but I didn't get the chest.The environment was I think interesting, I really liked how you did the layers of the inside and outside of the ship to make that cut away effect, it's really nice.\u00a0 Nice entry!",
      "When the music rings, I know I have found the right game.",
      "Made me laugh and really enjoyed the simple-ness of walking into and killing the enemies. Location wasn't unique, but then flying on a rope was unique and interesting. Fun idea with rope jumping and attacking :)",
      "Like others, I\u00a0had difficulty with the rope, but other than that, I\u00a0had a blast playing! Nice work!",
      "I\u00a0really enjoyed this :)",
      "The moment I climb that rope and got away with the parrot and the music: EPIC",
      "Enjoyed it, i would a bit work on rope climbing engine, however it looks really unique\u00a0:)))",
      "The only problem was how both the timing and the location of grabbing the rope with Up are way too precise. Regardless, this was fun!",
      "I enjoyed the game, though I did find it to be a bit tricky.",
      "amazing game! grabbing on the rope the parrot held didn't work sometimes, but other than that, amazing game! now enjoy this picture of a wall.",
      "Pretty cool take on the 2D platformer genre.\u00a0 The hitbox on the ropes is a little small.\u00a0 But overall, really solid entry.\u00a0\u00a0Would love to see you keep going with this game!",
      "Nice pirate themed level! Grabbing the rope is a bit tricky but the mechanics are well thought out, well done!",
      "I feel like its cheating to use pirates, everyone loves pirates!\u00a0 :^)",
      "The art and level design is great, the rope on a parrot has the potential to\u00a0be an entire game on its own.\u00a0If you wish to extend this concept, it would be great to allow the player to grab on to the rope if they have the up arrow held down, instead of only when it is pressed over the rope.",
      "Solid gameplay (and especially solid pirate heads!)",
      "I really like the art style! Plus the way you maneuver on the rope to doge the cannon balls was cool",
      "The game is very engaging and fun to play! Grabbing\u00a0the rope\u00a0was difficult,\u00a0but\u00a0apart\u00a0from\u00a0that\u00a0everything\u00a0was\u00a0awesome!",
      "Clever game, finnicky controls but the adventure was really fun, especially the parrot rope section with the cannon balls.",
      "Love the core concept of the game! The controls are quite a bit finnicky, hard to grab onto the rope properly and I also think the cannonball hitboxes could be adjusted, but these are pretty minor things. All in all it was very fun!",
      "this is a great game, great concept and execution, only little problem was that the rope controls were anoying as you couldnt get on a rope and press another button at the same time",
      "Great and chalenging in the same time. Like it.",
      "Great and chalenging in the same time. Like it.",
      "Great and chalenging in the same time",
      "This has so much potential! I wasn't able to beat it, even after watching the walkthrough, but I had fun trying. I'm not sure if anyone else said this, but I had no idea the initial cannonballs were cannonballs and I got killed right away. I couldn't tell if they had momentum coming towards me, so I thought they were collectables. I think the parrot could say something\u00a0when you grab the first rope, something about avoiding the cannonballs up ahead. But still, really good start!",
      "Great work, GameFavorites! I played this on stream and while the rope grabbing took some adjusting, I had a really fun time and loved the humor and style throughout. But I have to know ... how on Earth do i get to that last treasure chest!",
      "As others said, I loved the music and liked the layout! once I got familiar with the rope grabbing mechanic I\u00a0was able to clear.\u00a0 Really nice entry."

      "The character is really cute, and I love the floating mechanic!",
      "good job, I like hardcore\u00a0 games like this",
      "I played on stream and left feedback throughout if you want to watch the playback. I found myself frustrated a bit with the controls, but that doesn't matter for this round, you made a world and level I wanted to keep exploring. The characters were all cohesive and charming. I really wanted to beat the level, but kept getting tripped up on the chains ... I wasn't sure what was killing me. Great work here.",
      "Cute platformer but it glitches out for me on respawn.",
      "Very cool game. The hitboxes seems to be slightly off.",
      "I see a small triangle with legs and I am instantly captivated by this little guy - I want to see what happens next to him.",
      "I like the float ability and the light effects are good.\u00a0I think if the crystals acted as checkpoints it would make a major difference",
      "The lighting effect is cool, though becomes unforgiving as you tiptoe through the world. I suppose that could be part of the mechanic though, needing to rush to not be hit by spikes but still be careful to not fall in a pit. As others said, maybe some health could work (or, treat spikes as a wall instead of damange when touched from the side?",
      "The lighting is awesome.\u00a0 Reminds me of Thomas Was Alone.\u00a0 Super cool.\u00a0 I think the health system mentioned by others would be a good addition.\u00a0 Overall, nice entry!",
      "The lighting is good, the main character is cute. I think the jumping was a bit finicky as I wanted to float through some of the shorter hallways but bounced off the ceiling instead. Save points or a health system might be good as the level seemed pretty hard to me. Thanks!"

      "What a unique location i think you are 100% in the theme.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Exelente job.",
      "Interesting concept, I think I would have stuck with it for a little longer if it was less arduous to navigate around though (seems like with a mouse and pointer, could have naturally been a mouse navigation instead of a platformer!). Fun writing, and I do like how it leads you to go downwards, and also self reference partial hint/bad guesses.",
      "Really creative and unique location! I really enjoyed the writing and hunting down clues and riddles was a fun experience. Great job!",
      "Please don't judge me for the capslk incident!! That moment made me switch back to my normal keyboard for streaming, clickety clacky noises be damned! We had a lot of fun with this, if you couldn't tell from the stream. I enjoy your writing, as evidenced by me wanting to read notes that weren't part of solving the code. Great work.",
      "Cool and interesting game, but it's quite slow.",
      "Cool riddle game, and certainly a unique location. Only thing I didn't like was the movement, I think the player should have more gravity because it is a bit slow at the moment",
      "Wow! This was such a fun, chill puzzle experience. I really liked the movement and discovery of who the person was. Funny and intriguing.",
      "Amazing, but password having to be in bold makes no sense. Still haven't beaten it!",
      "Really cool game, do you have to click on the link to find the password?",
      "Very interesting usage of the cursor mechanic to move around the notes, felt weird but oddly right.",
      "Excellent concept! Had me intrigued and hoping I can see more of this game. Awesome job!",
      "this game was amazing but there is a small bug where if you put any random sequence of numbers into the password it tells you that it is helpful to find the clue",
      "Interesting to read all of the little notes",
      "Hints and Instructions helped a lot! Cool and truly unique game",
      "oh this was great! id love to see more of this concept",
      "Hahahahaha I loved this so much! Congrats on your first jam! Def one of the most unique locations! BOB AND DWAYNE SUCK! I wanted to explore more. Theres something so fun about going through someone else's reminders!",
      "",
      "Definitely a unique location, and I love the general puzzle/riddle idea! One small thing is the movement could be a little faster, but other than that really great!",
      "The concept for an APP as a setting is really cool. some of the notes are really funny and it was cool seeing some of the ones I suggested in there lol. the art style is also really nice and clean"
