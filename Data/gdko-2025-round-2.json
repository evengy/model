      "Superb, one of the entries that humble me when I see how well some people can fulfill the round's criteria. I can't see level's number but I'm probably near the end and it is quite enjoyable experience.",
      "This is one of my favorites from the round!\u00a0 The voice acting and story snippets were great, and the puzzle mechanics were super solid.\u00a0 Full five stars from me!",
      "Amazing Work! All the mechanics are really intuitive, yet can be really unique. I beat the last level without ever touching a button, like the VA didn't even finish there sentence before the robot walked into a laser, but the previous 9 levels made up for 110% of any finale. Great work!",
      "",
      "Amazing work. Nice voice acting! The art style was simple but readable and pleasant to look at, perfect for a puzzle game in my opinion. I loved how you could adjust all the elements of the map AND move the dog around.",
      "Very cool puzzle game! Had a great time playing it!",
      "I really like the mechanics, it's the classic \"laser + mirror\" deal but you've added so many twists to it that it feels completely fresh, and very engaging to play! I especially liked that the projectiles had limited range + having the range extender. The story was solid and the last level was very clever with revealing who the narrator was. 5 stars across the board.",
      "Great game with amazing storytelling! The puzzle part is quite solid, and the art style is really pleasing. I really like the reveal of the narrator's identity and how you made the last stage. Probably one of my favorite stories from this round.",
      "Very solid entry. Puzzle designs were great and it all came together nicely with narrative elements, visuals and sound design. Good job!",
      "I like\u00a0how\u00a0the\u00a0story is told\u00a0every level, it added a lot of flavor to the gameplay. The puzzles were nicely designed and I enjoyed solving them,\u00a0but I did\u00a0not find them to\u00a0be that challenging. Overall a very\u00a0nicely\u00a0done and enjoyable game, good job!\u00a0:D",
      "That was just fabulous! Great job! I really have nothing to add. :)",
      "the game looks and plays coolthe only thing that it lacks is the animal chracter becose the player character doesnt count",
      "9/10. You lost a point by making me cry at the end. Great story.",
      "I\u00a0loved the story and the mechanics. The puzzles were fun and challenging. Fantastic game!",
      "Very satisfying",
      "",
      "I managed to get to the eighth robot and would love to know what the solution is and what the other levels after are like. Having voice to tell the story was really good and I liked the puzzle designs very much. The amplifier and the one that can make the beam\u00a0pass through solids are an awesome way to enhance the projectiles",
      "Simple puzzle game but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so satisfying and as it introduces new elements it makes for new and interesting puzzles. And with voiceover narrative makes this even better.",
      "That are some nice puzzle levels you got there :) Good job on the design, i was stuck a bit on the 8th level. I think the story was a bit in the background, but still a nice entry for this round"

      "Excellent job as always!\u00a0 You had a really impressive amount of polish here, and the level design did a really good job of introducing the mechanics over time.",
      "Very enjoyable, cute\u00a0story and\u00a0well\u00a0thought projectile\u00a0mechanics,\u00a0nice job!",
      "Great game - very polished!\u00a0 I absolutely love the spider friend. really clever use of an animal and I love the mechanic for when the spider broke boxes and retrieved the ball.\u00a0\u00a0The only challenge for me was missing a shot and then having to go next to the enemy to get my ball for a second shot.\u00a0 Lastly, great story, I played all the way to the end and just wish there was more.\u00a0 This is one of my favorites so far and\u00a0I hope you get to continue it.",
      "Nice and cute experience.",
      "I absolutely love how satisfying the throwing feels with how the ball bounces on hit. The sound effects are great too! Cool mechanic with being able to break boxes by making the spider run though them.",
      "I think this was the first game I played before the voting period started and so it got burried in the back of my mind but here we are. It is cute and enjoyable, loved the fetching spider, and looking at rating criteria you got it all amazingly well covered, for indeed the animal is crucial to\u00a0 gameplay and even has to do with projectile, great job.",
      "I loved the artstyle and the ball chasing mechanics! From the other comments it looks like this is a prequel to your other submissions, so I will have to check them out!",
      "Oh!\u00a0It's a prequel story to previous GDKO games ?\u00a0Very engaging)",
      "First of all, the art is gorgeous (as expected). The tie in with Crunkle's was unexpected but fun. I think that the animals and projectiles were done exceedingly well, as both have multiple uses and both have uses that tie in with one another, amazing job with that. The story wasn't as integrated with the gameplay as I might have liked. Also minor nitpick but I don't think a single one of the signs was ever helpful to me, every one I read I'd already discovered the mechanic for myself, which was more fun in my opinion. They were probably a good inclusion for any players that didn't figure out the mechanics but for me personally they kind of took away immersion. This really came together as a complete product so great job with that, wonderful work!",
      "That was\u00a0pretty fun!\u00a0The story felt a bit\u00a0random at times\u00a0but\u00a0it was enjoyable\u00a0nonetheless.\u00a0Seeing\u00a0the spider barge through boxes\u00a0was\u00a0pretty\u00a0unexpected and a funny game mechanic.\u00a0Overall\u00a0a\u00a0pretty\u00a0nice game\u00a0:D good job!",
      "Fun art style. We thought of a similar concept somewhere (like an animal friend going to fetch stuff for you and puzzles based on that). But our implementation is flawless. Loved it.",
      "The shooting\u00a0mechanic was\u00a0fun, and worked\u00a0really\u00a0well with the\u00a0animal companion.\u00a0I\u00a0really\u00a0liked\u00a0how\u00a0the\u00a0projectile had weight to\u00a0it,\u00a0felt\u00a0really\u00a0purposeful when\u00a0I\u00a0was\u00a0shooting\u00a0it.\u00a0The art\u00a0is gorgeous and the\u00a0progression\u00a0is tight\u00a0with a\u00a0nice easy to remember backtrack\u00a0path that\u00a0makes the\u00a0world feel really\u00a0open. It was also a really good length for a jam game, long enough to give an experience but short enough to not outstay its welcome. bug free too. I look forward to the next episode!super\u00a0awesome\u00a0job!",
      "Such an awesome game, I love to see the tie in with Crunkle's Sideshow!",
      "I love the art style. Reminds me of Bomberman Quest in a way. Fun mechanics, and my playthrough way bug free, unless you count the spider as a bug. I\u00a0have no criticism.",
      "This is only part 1? Already felt like a complete game. Can't wait to see what's next",
      "You could tell me that this game world was ripped straight out of any of the Zelda games on GB, and I'd believe it. You\u00a0did such a good job on the environment and I love it. Half expecting an owl like figure to tell me where to go to find the master sword. The story was really cool and loved how you've made it as a spin off to a larger universe. Projectile system was perfect for the task and you nailed the criteria for this round. Awesome job.",
      "Great game and story",
      "Love the chunkiness of the art style!",
      "Throwing the ball and having the creature bring it back to violet is a\u00a0really cool mechanic, especially with\u00a0how you expanded the mechanic to directing the creature to smashing the crates. I like the story too and it's good to see crunkle again :)",
      "Great game and story! The projectile and spider work well together. I really like the art style.",
      "Well deserved 5 star rating. Really good job! I like how the spider has multiple purposes, even breaking walls i cant traverse without it. Great story too and it fits so well into the universe you built with your other games. :)",
      "Graphics and sound are awesome!",
      "Very cute\u00a0polished\u00a0game!

      "This was a really impressive game, and your mechanics worked great!\u00a0 I found that when I tried to slide under one of the swords from the trap, the character automatically stood back up after sliding instead of staying crouched, so I got hit a bunch by sliding instead of crouching by accident, so I would recommend crouching after a slide, but that's just a little nitpicky thing.\u00a0 Great game!",
      "I really want to see this being expanded on! Liked the story and the gameplay. Smart and unique!",
      "It's still an impressive mechanism. The story and map go well together.",
      "I really liked this platformer a lot.\u00a0 I think you did a great job of teaching us how to play.\u00a0\u00a0And, I really liked that the difficulty wasn't that hard.\u00a0 \u00a0The spear mechanic was also very cool, both for killing and for getting to higher areas.\u00a0\u00a0Really well done.",
      "Well done ! I like the whole look and setup of the game. I did not pass the part where i had to dodge projectible and fighting monster at the same time. But i definitely want to try again. well done !",
      "This game has come a long way from round 1. The platforming was overall very enjoyable, I did struggle with the section when you have to climb the pillar using multiple spears. Couldn't always get the spear to throw when I was standing on another, something to do with the ground check I'm assuming. Overall you hit all the main criteria for this round so well done! Great job!",
      "Great spear\u00a0mechanics!",
      "Love the dialogue and the cute art. Nice voice acting.\u00a0The character animations were super polished. The spear platforming and the sliding under the oncoming projectiles was very satisfying as well.",
      "Loved it. It had a very cinematic platformer feel , like prince of persia or flashback.",
      "hi the story\u00a0are great animal fits the game perfecly the only thing that i hate is that the jumping is realy slow and it slowes the paste of game but exept for that nice game",
      "This was cool! I\u00a0had a lot of trouble with the platforming, but I\u00a0can see what you were going for. I love some of the puzzles!",
      "Ah, very excellent spear mechanics and the dog was a great. Had some issues with the controls, but it was really fun.",
      "Another metroidvania! This was cute but everything just felt slow, especially with the amount of times you need to navigate back and forth through the same areas. I really liked having the central mechanic of a spear that you upgrade throughout the game but the dog as a mechanic felt horrible and was very glitchy, the part where you need to use it on the button I just skipped over.\u00a0The spear being used for both platforming and combat was neat but the combat was lacking and with only a limited amount of enemies in the game that don't respawn I was left wanting a little more.\u00a0 Having most of the falls result in you just having to repeat a section you've already done several times was a little bit cruel. I still got some enjoyment out of it, though.\u00a0Overall, nicely done.",
      "Almost everything out the movement feels great! With the exception of the spears, they feel overall slow. The amount of times I tried to throw a spear while jumping, or running and was just denied is countless. The story however, was really fun! It's simple, but made a great addition. Still one of my favorite games from round 1!",
      "I really like the idea behind throwing a spear and being able to use it as a platform. Good work."

      "I liked the game when I played it last and I think it fit really well for round 1. I see how you extended it but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel significantly different nor aligned with the task for round 2. I wish there was something about the shooting projectiles a little earlier.",
      "Great work. The platforming feels even better than what I remember from last round, and the story delivery through signs was a good choice to keep in there. It's a minor criticism but I wish you had added some new dialogue at the beginning instead of re-using old dialogue from round 1, but it's not enough to detract from my overall rating since all the story stuff was extra last round anyway.",
      "This was a cool concept.\u00a0 I'm pretty confused by the level design, and I'm even more unsure what the story was about, but the platforming controls feel great! At the same time, for some reason the dash stops working during the lava part, and I can't always get the walljump to work.",
      "Well done! We all need a friend like Billy :D",
      "this game has a really good walljump, i may be weird starting with that but i love the walljump, its really smooth, hedgegod and bullet were cool but i wanted more animals.. but overall pretty cool!",
      "This game was still cute and still fun. There was still some jank from the first round and I'm not sure if the secret and desert levels are meant to loop. pew pew noise funny.\u00a0 The platformer controller felt good, I still had the same issue with the camera as I did in the first round. I wish it stayed as zoomed out as it was in the tutorial level(s). The platforming is very fun and it was an enjoyable enough time, nicely done!",
      "I'm not sure if I missed something or if the pipe level is meant to loop infinitely with the desert level, but regardless It was fun! Ducky Sign is still as fun as I remember them being, and Mr. Box is still very funny to me for some reason. This game has a TON of personality, I just wish there was more of it to see!",
      "The pew pew noises from the gun are spectacular",

The first time it was completely black on each level, the second time it had that stringy foreground color, but the background was still purple>My cursor also disappeared on multiple occasions, mainly when choosing pills",
      "Great game. \u00a0Really professional and polished. \u00a0I loved the story, the combat, and the upgrades. \u00a0Unfortunately, I wasn't very good and couldn't save my dog, but I\u00a0liked trying.",
      "I almost got ending B on my first try, but instead I got hit once. Loved the gameplay! It was all so lovingly crafted to be as fine tuned as it could be. The movement felt so natural, the combat was fluid and fun, and the upgrades added so much enjoyment. The visuals and audio are also on point. The story was great!",

      "The polish on this game for a short period of time is incredible. The upgrades had a surprising amount of variety.\u00a0It seems like the green pills expire after you win with them which isn't really explained and just discourages you from picking them even if they are fun upgrades. The criteria was addressed amazingly, the animal was cute and fun and the projectiles and combat were really fun. I didn't encounter any bugs except for I named my dog gamergirlxxx and that caused the text to have a stroke when it says their name at the start cutscene/dialogue. That's about the smallest issue ever but I felt like I should mention it. There could have been maybe just a little more juice, especially upon killing an enemy.\u00a0I found the story enjoyable but I really don't think I can do another sad dog story \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ad.\u00a0Fantastic job!",

Keen to see how the game balance could progress further, I found myself a little OP in the last few rounds with all the upgrades I chose (that doesn't really factor into the ranking) just thought might be some nice feedback.

      "This was great. Fluid gameplay with a touching story. I liked the little touch on the stage names. I wish I had seen it during the rating period. I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still have time today but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already closed.\nThere seems to be some minor issue with the background. At some point it went black and stayed black. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect gameplay.\nAlso unrelated, did you draw the spirtes yourself? I love them. I actually have been working on a game where I have an enemy that looks almost the same as your 9 eye monster thing. I also have a black outline shader very similar to yours :)",

      "Love how well the cutscene conveys the story despite being simple stills with audio! Wonderful job",
      "The opening cutscene is really well done and I like the audio throughout. I managed to get the blade of reversal and the 3D environment you made is looking cool. Unfortunately I didn't see any projectiles so I might be missing something",

      "It's a shame that you didn't have much time because the game looks promising. Story cutscene look nice, the goblin dialogue were fun and i really like game with parrying as the main mechanics."

I think more waves of enemies would have been nice, along with walls to prevent the player from falling off of the map. I liked the story, it was an interesting meta take although I think the cut to gameplay was a little abrupt and felt a little bit disjointed.

The animation is very smooth. My only complaint would be that it didn't have jump buffering and coyote time for the platforming parts. Since it's not a platforming-heavy game, it's not a big problem."

      "Oscar for best original story\u00a0)",
      "Awesome game. Superb story. And LOTS of math. Every time a new mechanic was introduced, it was given ample time for the player to learn what they do. Some levels felt much easier than others, but overall the game stayed at a nice difficulty curve that never swayed to far in either direction. Excellent work!",
      "this game should be mandatory for schools i love it.",
      "Yep... math is still hard.",
      "I would definitely buy a \"full\u00a0version\"\u00a0of\u00a0this. The\u00a0world\u00a0needs\u00a0more\u00a0cool\u00a0math games\u00a0<3",
      "Seriously, unique and original game.\u00a0 I can't believe how much you were able to create and pack in here during a game jam.\u00a0 The cut scenes were awesome.\u00a0 The humor throughout is great.\u00a0\u00a0And, I love math games (as evidenced by my game \"PEMDAS\" in the first round).\u00a0 Really well done.\u00a0 I hope you get to move on.",
      "That intro scene is the most amazing thing I have ever seen, combined with the music. Very clever and even poetic.",
      "Top marks from me. Loved it. I was a little daunted at first because of how many puzzles you said there were, but they were quick to get through so it didn't take too long. Funny story, good puzzles, and a great game.",
      "This was really cool and had a truly impressive amount of polish!\u00a0 That's five stars across the board from me!!",
      "Amazing game and story! At first, I thought the math would be simple, but I'm glad it got more and more complicated as the game progressed. All the art and the funny story added some absurdity to this math game and made it very enjoyable. Great job!",
      "I do not think, therefore I do not am.",
      "The story is very engaging and definitely kept me all the way to the end. I'll admit that I had to skip a lot because the math got pretty complex, especially as I've never heard of things like abs. It was good watching the pigeon follow the path but the story is what is the main thing for me, great job with the art and dialogue!",
      "This game\u00a0does\u00a0so\u00a0many\u00a0things\u00a0right,\u00a0it\u00a0has a funny story, an unique\u00a0mechanic, could\u00a0defintely\u00a0be\u00a0on\u00a0coolmathgames, has bonus levels (that aren't mandatory) and\u00a0has nice soundtrack to\u00a0go\u00a0with\u00a0it.\u00a0Good\u00a0job!",
      "Ok this was\u00a0hilarious. Excellent storytelling and\u00a0I\u00a0love\u00a0how\u00a0the\u00a0pigeon\u00a0projectiles are\u00a0math functions\u00a0:D Halfway through the game\u00a0I\u00a0learned to embrace\u00a0some\u00a0delicious sinus wave\u00a0cheese spam so\u00a0I didn't solve the puzzles as\u00a0intended, and\u00a0I'm sure the pigeons\u00a0would be concussed\u00a0if they\u00a0could think.\u00a0But\u00a0obviously they can't.",
      "Having read some of Descartes previous to this game, I\u00a0could not stop laughing. I want you to make a game with this type of narrative for every type of ancient mathematician. Actually, I want this kind of narrative for any historical figure ever. Well done, perfect game IMO",
      "I loved this reimagining of Descartes. I studied Philosophy at University and got a real kick out of the story! Extremely original and humorous. I'm not a big math guy but the mechanics were well implemented and can't really find any faults with this game at all. I got about halfway through the game, I was waiting to see if there would be some kind of pun to do with \"Cogito Ergo Sum\", maybe it happened later or I missed it. Great work!",
      "Initially, I was hesitant to play your game because of the math, but I'm glad I finally gave it a try. Your unique take on the task for this round was impressive. I especially appreciated the option to skip puzzles; my old brain wasn't functioning well this morning. The original story captivated me and kept me engaged until the end. Well done!",
      "Wow. You made math fun. Going into this I wasn't sure what to expect and was kind of disappointed at first, but quickly fell in love with the game. It's so simple yet there's a lot of depth, especially in the optional levels which are a really great addition. The writing and story is great and the art serves as a great vessel to move it forward. I really like the trig and absolute value questions, I think that's when I really started enjoying myself. I'm going to be honest I'm surprised but this is one of my favorites so far, well done!",
      "You sir are the worst kind of scoundrel, forcing us to learn math just to find out what happens when he gets to Sweden.\u00a0 In all honesty though, I didn't play many games yet but this one feels like top 3 to me, it was a joy. Excellent writing, inventiveness, and though graphics are simple they are fitting the time period. Seriously, this story goes places, I'd recommend everyone to play through. The only complaint, maybe the 2nd level in the third optional branch is unsolvable, but I could be just stupid.",
      "Absolutely amazing! I was scrolling through the list and saw Descartes and maths, so had to play it first this round! Loved the way you used the story to blend with the mathematics to blend with the jokes!Full marks from me! Great work on the narrative, the art, the jokes, wow! Also\u00a0the\u00a0branching/harder questions\u00a0were\u00a0a\u00a0great\u00a0touch,\u00a0parallel\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0story",

      "I wish the knife was more usable as a melee weapon, but it's range is genuinely so bad you are damn near forced to throw it constantly, and given how there are zero repercussions for spamming the throw button, it leads to the melee combat feeling underwhelming. Which is a shame, as I LOVE melee combat. It was fun game nonetheless. It's fairly rare to see a 3D Game, so great work!",
      "I love old school Doom and I really enjoyed this game. \u00a0Although, it actually reminded me more of Castle Wolfenstein (which I\u00a0also love).\u00a0 Anyway, this was a lot of fun and the rat made for a nice change of pace challenge. \u00a0Oddly, this might have been one of the few games I think was a little too easy, but I'm sure if you continue it, you can begin to ramp up the challenges. \u00a0Really well done!",
      "Cool game!\u00a0I\u00a0never used melee because throwing the knives\u00a0felt\u00a0way\u00a0more\u00a0useful\u00a0:D and\u00a0I\u00a0also love\u00a0the\u00a0hyper intelligent\u00a0rat companion avoiding death blenders just to help you\u00a0out. Enemies could be a\u00a0bit more threatening as they\u00a0felt very passive\u00a0right now.",
      "This was really great!!\u00a0 The rat for opening doors was a really great way to follow the prompt that built the story as well.\u00a0 One thing I will say is that I really never found a use for the melee attack since I had infinite knives and the melee hit didn't seem to do more damage.\u00a0 For this jam I don't think that matters, though!\u00a0 Great job!",
      "Absolutly love the visual but I think that there should be more enemies in the rooms",
      "I love the style of this. I\u00a0can't think of a single thing I\u00a0dislike. Well done!",
      "It was lot of fun to talk to my rat fren and get them to open doors. I would love to see you continue to develop this ;)",
      "I love retro fps games. And here you nailed\u00a0the aesthetic, the ambience and the SFX. The monster designs are really cute, and I liked the rat platforming (ratforming?) sections.",

      "I loved the style of game, I\u00a0made one myself that I called \"Doomish\" a few years back for a game dev challenge. Good story and controlling the rat was great. Fun game. Too bad some bugs got in the way of the fun.",
      "In memory of Jerry, haha!",
      "Love me a boomer shooter. I think you've got a recipe for something really cool here, it just needs a killer soundtrack and fleshing out a little more. You nailed the DOOM visuals and feel of the game. I thought the rat tunnels mechanic was really fun, clever way to fit the task into your game. I had fun. Well done man!",
      "I\u00a0just gave this a try. I\u00a0liked it overall. I like the precision required on the rat segments and throwing the knives."

      "The story was so cute! I love the cutscenes. The shooting mechanics were really tough to control to be honest, but everything else about the game is perfect!",
      "",
      "I've never seen anyone succeed in expanding on elements of Katamari Damacy like this. Especially with regard to the fidelity and rationality of the story, it is enough to call this game the original Katamari Damacy.",
      "Im happy to see you continued on this game! Very cute opening cutscene and a good expansion on the gameplay of the game!",
      "That was a fun time. Good Job.",
      "Absolutely amazing opening - your storytelling and animation is fantastic!\u00a0 Also, I love the way you teach us how to play, while still continuing the story.\u00a0 You actually made a cute dung beetle that I cared about.\u00a0\u00a0The 3d world was amazing.\u00a0I just wish I was better at moving around it, but the more I played, the better I got.\u00a0 \u00a0Overall, seriously impressive world you've created with some of the best animation I've seen!"

I reached dead ends\u00a0on\u00a0both the left side and right side of the\u00a0map,\u00a0and\u00a0I\u00a0assume the dead end at the right side\u00a0is the end\u00a0as you \"leave\" the\u00a0abandoned area. I\u00a0like that the\u00a0level design\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0bit\u00a0convoluted, but at the same time you have the\u00a0battery\u00a0mechanic which\u00a0forces you to fully explore\u00a0an area\u00a0as you can't go\u00a0back\u00a0later without\u00a0any batteries.\u00a0Not much of a problem right now\u00a0(unless I somehow missed the ending) but\u00a0if you\u00a0plan to expand\u00a0on\u00a0this mechanic\u00a0it's something to\u00a0keep\u00a0in\u00a0mind.",

      "Loved the game, that is a good doggo!",
      "I liked this a lot!\u00a0 Using the animal to help look for batteries was a really good use of the theme.\u00a0 One thing I would recommend is making the animal's role a little more clear from the start, maybe by adding a tiny bit more instruction.\u00a0 It took a second to understand that \"press e to search for batteries\" meant having the animal go look, and \"nearest battery is too high or too far\" had me thinking I had to climb for a while before realizing it just meant the animal couldn't find a path.\u00a0 Once it clicked I really liked it though, and overall I think the mechanic worked out really well!\u00a0 Great job!",
      "The pet mechanic was a very cool and inventive implementation of the theme! I also enjoyed the free-form exploration of the different areas in the level",
      "The bomb system is a good addition to your previous game, in my opinion there could be even more digging around.It got me a while to realize the cat is used to search batteries, but that definitely made finding batteries more focused. Nice job with the storytelling too, using letters instead of basic narrative was a good idea.",
      "The story was great and you got the projectile and animal mechanics in there with the bombs and cat. Fun game.",
      "Love the story! I wish the cat did something more than just walk around with me. I\u00a0couldn't figure out what \"Q\" was supposed to do. Fun game otherwise!"

      "it's really good, both playably and visually are 10, very good job!",
      "Easy 5 stars for you. This is amazing, great job as always! The only critique i would have is that the screen is a bit to pixelated if played in fullscreen, in my opinion. If I only have the small display, around half my screen size it looks great, but in fullscreen the pixels are a bit too big. Nothing dramatic though, so good job! :)",
      "Amazing work, I loved the different areas, a very fun game to play and unique look to it.",
      "I had the pleasure to test this game while it was still in development and I have to say I'm really impressed with how it turned out in the end! I like how you made the spikes less punishing in this version, it was a really good decision.",
      "Very ambitious,\u00a0cute\u00a0and\u00a0well\u00a0done!",
      "Veeeery cool game!\u00a0Super cute art-style!\u00a0Waiting for full release ;)",
      "I\u00a0absolutely love your art style.\u00a0\u00a0It is so cool.\u00a0 Also, the opening images were amazing.\u00a0 What a great way to begin your story.\u00a0 UnfortunatelyI'm just terrible at these kind of games, so\u00a0I wasn't able to get to far into it, but I'm really impressed with what I saw.\u00a0 Lastly, I thought the music was fantastic too.",
      "The metroidvania elements with the minimap were super good!\u00a0 I also really loved the art style and the story.\u00a0 One thing I would recommend is finding ways to make things a little clearer to make sure the low res pixel style isn't getting in the way.\u00a0 The two places I think were a little hard for me were enemy hits and the spikes.\u00a0 At first I thought I had missed the enemies when I dashed, so I think just making the hits really extra obvious would help.\u00a0 Also, it took dying a few times to realize that I was running into spikes.\u00a0 I know spikes can be hard in a low pixel style cause you can't get the sharp points that scream \"this is a spike,\" but maybe something with the animation again like a blood spurt or having the spikes light up red when\u00a0 you hit them so that it's really clear what you ran into that made one of your eggs break.\u00a0 Overall this is a beautiful game and entry and I'd love to see more!",
      "Fun game, I do like metroidvanias.\u00a0I think you got all the elements needed for the round. The art and style are great and the progression was good.\u00a0Great work!",
      "Wow. This was a great entry. Simple but effective storytelling. The visual style of the game, with the downscaling and the little wobbles looks great. I may had preferred the opening cutscene to follow the same style. The game feels complete very complete. Minor complain is the very first spikes jump, that was a little frustrating until I realized I could hold down space to \u00e2\u0080\u009cjump\u00e2\u0080\u009d further.",
      "Bravo for making a metroidvania and a good one at that too, it's certainly an ambitious thing to do for a game jam.\u00a0The opening cutscene with that comic book style is done really well and tells the story very clearly.\u00a0I really like the artwork throughout the game but I think the outline comic artwork is better than the pixel art even though both are absolutely gorgeous by all accounts.\u00a0I didn't get to explore all of what you created and it's mainly because I am not used to the controls (for me W to jump, space to dash is my norm) and I need to stop to make food so ran out of time. I got 4 health eggs, saw a 5th but couldn't get past the spikes and got the glide ability in the pink area. I enjoyed what I got to see and\u00a0I appreciate the checkpoints and minimap and at no point did I feel lost. I think marking the nests on the minimap and any powerup that you see but didn't get on there would be a good thing to do if you expand the game.\u00a0I think it would an improvement if the enemies died in one hit and the general difficulty was lowered at least to begin with.\u00a0I liked the bees, but I\u00a0found the bats difficult to defeat and think if they stayed still it would be an easier time\u00a0and I think an even easier enemy like a\u00a0snail that crawls around the walls could be cool. I think it was the spikes that I died most on though. There were times when I had a powerup and it said click any button and in my haste to dismiss the prompt\u00a0I would click my mouse to close the window and end up dashing to my death. There was also a section where I dashed through to the next room and I immediately fell down into spikes as the momentum carried over or maybe it was just\u00a0me I forget but that section was a tough one to get past but I managed it a number of times and was probably more difficult for me because of jumping, gliding and dashing all at once\u00a0with controls I'm not familiar with more than anything else. All in all, I think it's a really great game with a lot of great platforming in it, which is exactly the type of game I love\u00a0and the artwork is stunning and some really great upgrade abilities in there too. Hope my feedback helps in some way.\u00a0One last suggestion:  I think the dash ability would be more rewarding if it were earned rather than available from the start and if that flower above the spikes wasn't there as I was looking at that instead of the spikes",
      "I find it hard to\u00a0comment\u00a0on this game.\u00a0I'm generally not\u00a0a\u00a0big fan of\u00a0platformers\u00a0if the\u00a0movement\u00a0doesn't\u00a0\"fit\" for me.\u00a0So\u00a0I didn't get very far\u00a0in this game.\u00a0I'm gonna dump\u00a0my thoughts\u00a0but they might\u00a0mean\u00a0nothing\u00a0to you as\u00a0I'm definitely\u00a0not the target audience for this game\u00a0:D\u00a0but\u00a0I'm doing\u00a0it anyway\u00a0because it\u00a0looks like a\u00a0lot\u00a0of\u00a0thought and effort was\u00a0put into this game and you stated you want to develop\u00a0it further.",

      "Very well made with good room layout. With this being a story round I'm going into the mindset of finishing all games, but I might regret it if every game takes 35 minutes...The initial dash-jump felt a bit too difficult, was stuck on it for a good minute or two, and accidentally jump right after initial respawn, which made we go into the room above the spawn. Other than that the game felt bug free and polished. The lack of sfx is definitely an issue, but the adaptive music makes up for it, awesome job with that! (I didn't notice it changing dynamically at first, but when I did, I noticed that you even change it depending on the biome, AWESOME!)I heard about the healing issue, I never understood it and wouldn't even known that it was a thing if I hadn't looked at the comments, might be the last room I didn't get tho. This might partly explain why I felt the game was a bit too hard, but I would've had an even better time if it was just a tad easier.The non main character animals (enemies) don't feel that important in terms of them \"being animals\" since they don't behave much like them anyways. The little peeps on the way were cute though.Overall I really appreciated the game, tho I wish you'd spent more time polishing (sfx) instead of adding more rooms. I know that it's hard making a \"tiny\" metroidvania I believe a game jam game should never be much longer than 15 minutes as very few people will actually get to the finish and get that satisfaction.Damn that 99% is annoying me more and more while I write this review.Also\u00a0I\u00a0think\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0longest game jam\u00a0game\u00a0review\u00a0I've ever written, I\u00a0guess\u00a0it's fitting\u00a0though\u00a0for\u00a0such\u00a0a content packed game.",
      "Such a beautiful game with a really good Metroidvania vibe! Though the game is a little too hard for me, I still enjoyed the gameplay a lot.",

If you were to keep continuing with your project\u00a0I think it would be really cool if you could teleport the birds when you shoot them\u00a0and I think when hovering over the upgrade buttons if they were green it would improve it visually.

What a soul purifying and destroying experience. You really nailed the storytelling part (and also the other parts), what a genius masterpiece. 5/5 game in every category but\u00a0I'll never want to play it again.ALSO the way you tell the story via simple gameplay works really well, it\u00a0reminds me of Edith Finch and some of the minigames there, especially the baby bath and swing ones. Don't know if you've played it but had to mention.",
      "There's not much gameplay but the story is quite touching and it manages to address every part of the criteria decently well. I found the story to be a bit predictable but it was still enjoyable and kept me playing. The customization options were surprisingly robust. Sometimes the dog would run in a circle around the ball instead of picking it up for me which doesn't seem intended but other than that I didn't run into any bugs. Overall, good job!",

      "This game, by far, has the best story I've played yet. The art style adds such a pleasant feel, while the audio is just so calming. The only real complaint I have is that I didn't know you can throw the ball until I read the description. Fantastic work!",
      "",
      "Amazing work. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite games from this round. The storytelling, the art, the animation, everything comes together so nicely.",
      "You had no business making me this sad :( . This is the type of game I would pay to play. The music, the graphics, the gameplay, the polish - everything. This game is so well made. One of my top 3 in GDKO round 2",
      "This was a really nice game! It made me dreadfully sad but the bit at the end when you get to say goodbye was a nice touch. Wonderful work!",
      "Love the title art and the begin screen, very stylish.",
      "Sorry, I\u00a0already suffered through one other entry that was a tragic dog story, I find such topic to be in bad taste for a jam game and with currently having a dog I don't want to think about such things. I cannot play this, though looking at screenshots I'm sure you did fine work. Same like with the other game, I will not rate, which is only fair as I did not play it, but thank you for playing and rating mine.",
      "This was such a touching story - we've had to go through grieving for our put a couple of times and it never gets easier. Everything in the game worked very well together!",
      "So sweet TT________TT",
      "I instantly saw this story coming from the first moment as it was nearly exactly the same as my first idea for a game. I think that makes it all the more impressive that I was the most moved by this compared to any other story so far. Being able to play with the dog for a bit and then choose to move on really brought touched me, probably partially due to the loss of my own dog a few years prior\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u0095.\u00a0I think the projectiles were a little underused as I only really used them in one level and a little bit in another one. The atmosphere was fantastic and I loved talking to the NPCs and the little quest, although it was a small addition it really made the world feel that much more alive. I only had one or two bugs, the first level's elevator didn't go down for me for awhile and I thought there was something I had to do but I just didn't trigger it somehow. Great job but I don't think I can handle anotheroop the dog's deadgame.",
      "Absolutely loved all of this game. No notes from me, really great game!",
      "This game had such a fantastic atmosphere and the narrative aspects were top tier.\u00a0\u00a0Great entry for the story round.",
      "Another fetch game\u00a0:D",
      "The Narrative component and platforming of this game were really polished, I really liked the vibe/aesthetic you created and the way the themes of loss were handled. The flash like graphics of the characters along with the music gave a really nostalgic feel to the game which sort of drove that even deeper for me, beautiful entry to the jam!",
      "This was great! You definitely took the storytelling prompt and cranked it up to 11. Wish there was more tennis ball mechanics. Definitely the core of the projectile imo.",

      "",
      "The way the story unfolds through the different characters is really good and I like that it's also a personal story for your dog Mako. The bouncy ball as a\u00a0projectile that also returns\u00a0is a fun weapon against the creatures.  For feedback, I think the throwing animation could be improved.\u00a0Seeing the dog at the end and playing fetch with it was a nice way to end your game",
      "10/10 would play fetch with the big doggo again",
      "Did not play the game yet but this thumbnail immediately pulls me in \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d",
      "Got goosebumps!",
      "Such an amazing experience. You did a great job on this one, im really glad i played it <3",
      "Amazing game\u00a0and\u00a0I\u00a0love\u00a0the\u00a0art.\u00a0The\u00a0pacing was\u00a0a\u00a0bit\u00a0slow\u00a0as in\u00a0speed\u00a0of\u00a0everything, especially\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0platforms\u00a0I\u00a0would\u00a0often\u00a0reach\u00a0the\u00a0second one\u00a0but\u00a0just\u00a0not\u00a0in\u00a0time\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0to\u00a0wait.\u00a0Just\u00a0offsetting\u00a0the\u00a0platforms\u00a0a\u00a0bit\u00a0so\u00a0you\u00a0can reach\u00a0them\u00a0easily\u00a0in\u00a0time\u00a0wouldve\u00a0helped.\u00a0Other\u00a0then\u00a0that\u00a0I\u00a0love\u00a0the\u00a0story\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0art\u00a0is just\u00a0amazing!\u00a0gj!",
      "The graphics are very pretty. The platforming is simple but effective, with the caveat that in some of the moving platform sections it was all too slow just waiting. Also, I liked how the ball bounced and it was meaningful at the end (no spoilers) and I know I could use it on some enemies (but not others for some reason), but I wish the projectiles had some more use. Also, the prompt was for the animal to be part of the gameplay. You made it part of the story. Still, a great entry.",
      "Simply brilliant!\u00a0 I think it's my favorite game so far.\u00a0 Amazing story and storytelling.\u00a0 \u00a0The pacing throughout was great for me and it matched the story.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I adored the look of it.\u00a0 The music was fantastic, as was the ending (sweet and sad).\u00a0 \u00a0Also, such a perfect title.\u00a0\u00a0If this isn't in the top ten I will be very unhappy.",
      "Excellent game ! You did a great job telling that story."

      "I liked it a lot! Well done! :DTho I sometimes got stuck when throwing the dice, if I released to far up, I would click out from the game, when I click on the game again, the dices are stuck and I'm not able to do anything",
      "Very, very\u00a0cool battles!\u00a0 Nice touch with literally hitting enemies with the dice.",
      "This is one of my favorite games in the jam.\u00a0 I love the dice and the multiple ways we can use them for combat.\u00a0 Lots of cool strategy to work with here.\u00a0 I liked this a lot and I really hope you get to continue it.",
      "Ok this\u00a0is\u00a0a gem.\u00a0Cool story,\u00a0neat dice combat\u00a0mechanic\u00a0(and\u00a0I\u00a0love that the dice physically hurt the\u00a0enemies lol)\u00a0overall\u00a0pretty solid!\u00a0I\u00a0did\u00a0notice\u00a0that\u00a0half the level doesn't seem to have\u00a0any\u00a0colliders,\u00a0but\u00a0it's\u00a0not a\u00a0problem since you can\u00a0just choose to not walk through walls.",
      "Love the art and the writing. Love me some Greek mythology.",
      "This was one of my favourite story driven games in the jam. Loved the general vibe and the writing was very well done. I enjoyed the game mechanics as well, think you've made something you should be very proud of! Great job!",
      "Excellent concept ! The damage on throwing dice is a really cool idea. Very fun, congrats !",
      "Pretty good\u00a0concept, throwing\u00a0dice\u00a0was\u00a0never\u00a0this\u00a0fun!",
      "What a mean rabbit.",
      "Really cool game! The y-sorting and collision didn't seem to be working sadly and I had to restart after trying to roll my dice. I think that the dice as projectiles were really cool and the animal was worked in very well. I think the battle music could have had a slightly longer loop as I found it quite grating after a bit but that's small criticism. Everything worked really well together and I think you did a great job!",
      "I really liked the dice throwing as the projectile mechanic and the story was great and engaging.\u00a0 I liked the die mechanics as well, they were really fun. Great game!",
      "Dude, well done. I have things that are \"wrong\" but everything about this is incredible. I can't wait to see what you do in round 3!",
      "I love the story and gameplay. Using rolling dice as projectiles is very creative. There are some slight issues in the world map - the y-sorting isn't working properly and some borders have no collision.",
      "Neat and just my type of game. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice expansion on your round 1 game. I get Dicey Dungeon vibes from playing it. Just needs a bit of sounds effects and battle effects to start making the combat feel really good. Great job."

      "I liked the concept a lot. Using the tongue as the hookshot and shooting flies as the projectile was great and fits the mechanics challenge. I felt like the story was a little light but the game was fun. Well done!",
      "It's a shame that you weren't able to finish this project, I really see the potential for a great game here in the style of UltraKill or Neon White.",
      "I want to see what happens next! This is such a cool concept, and I can't wait to see what happens next!",
      "I like the idea and the ninja frog mechanics - actually, I think this would've done really well during the first round, game mechanics & progression are both well implemented! So I'm happy you managed to publish this even tho you were busy. Okay but a funny story:\u00a0I noticed that for some reason\u00a0I acted as I was playing a fps game and tried to reload my gun by pressing R. That of course didn't reload anything but instead I ended up resetting the level multiple times :') I have played too much Marvel Rivals lately, I think.",

      "This game reminds me of the flying levels in Cuphead. I think you took the prompt to heart with the story, too. Great job incorporating that.",
      "I'm impressed with how much story and how many characters you created with this.\u00a0\u00a0The flying and shooting is fun, but I do wish it was a little slower and I could see a little further in front of me.\u00a0 Still, this was a fun game that met all the requirements.",
      "I really like the amount of depth you put into the story!\u00a0 The intro story and characters were really great!",
      "did you write a novel or make a game? j/k just felt like there was more time spent reading dialogue here then playing the game game play was alright seemed a bit to easy to me though. great aesthetics though\u00a0\u00a0kinda felt like i watching amazing world of gumball.. i honestly started clicking through the story once i figured out how long it was...but im sure it was a good story started good anyways. just adhd really started kicking in about halfway through the 2 cutscene.",
      "I love the aesthetic of the dialogue and the transition to 3D during gameplay. I'm very impressed with the gecko model in particular.",
      "More people should talk about this game. I will make my kids and nephews and nieces\u00a0\u00a0play this if i every have any.\u00a0Great story, fun game, while the final boss fight was a bit tough for me, I\u00a0loved this game, probably one of my fav entries.",
      "The story and characters were amazing! You have a real talent for writing engaging dialogue - the shmup sections between dialogue sequences was a great change of pace as well.",
      "Awesome job with the narrative. The character's designs were very good and the shooting sections were fast paced fun. Love the genre mash up. Good job!",
      "Insane attention to detail in the narrative and a quirky cast of characters,\u00a0\u00a0a bit of a bullet hell in the last round which made for some fast pace action, will have to come back and see how it plays out if I choose the differing narrative options! Cool stuff!",
      "Well done making the game and the story!",
      "Interesting take on mixing visual novel with a side scrolling shooter. Fun game.",
      "This was a fun game! I\u00a0see what you were trying to do with all the different characters, but it made some points of the story confusing. I had to write down everyone's name and role to figure it out. I also wish the plane scenes were zoomed out more. Being that close in made it really hard to dodge enemies. Otherwise, I\u00a0love the concept, and hope there's a sequel on the horizon!"

      "Very cool :) I was very bad at this but I think was pretty awesome all the same :)",
      "great story, art was pretty good the controls as unique as they are wasnt the greatest.",
      "The story part of this game was sublime, the art and how everything worked together was perfect. I'll echo some of the other feedback and say that the controls weren't the easiest thing to get to grips with to say the least. I feel like if it was a little easier to control the drone this game could be right up there with the best in the jam!",
      "Amazing opening cutscene. Absolutely cursed gameplay. Glorbo has been avenged. You're next.",
      "An interesting game, it was fun. But why is turn left the button on the right, and turn right the button on the left? Loved the cutscene, but the levels were more about fighting the UI and controls than it was solving puzzles so it wasn't really my thing. Well done game though despite it not being a fit for me.",
      "The cutscenes and voice acting are amazing, the parrot impression is 10/10. But controls... I hate them, just simple WASD would be great, I could not pass the level 2 or 3 where are the first corners appeared, UX is like 0/10",
      "I'm so impressed, by your story and gameplay! How did you manage to make soo many levels! :D",
      "This is a cool concept!\u00a0I love the mystery and the birb. I think what the issue with difficulty comes down to is that you expect very precise movements with a very imprecise controller. This feels like a cursed issue where you want some imprecise controls to make for interesting gameplay, but then the difficulty of designing interesting levels with that restriction is huge.",
      "Very great cutscene and amazing voice acting! You have so many interesting shots in a short cutscene. The game is still quite difficult, but I'm glad that I can see all the levels\u00a0even though I had to skip some levels. It's quite impressive to have made so many levels. I really like how you trigger the ending by shooting the projectile."

      "Just here to drop off a well-deserved full five-star review!\u00a0 My only complaint is that healing cards took off so much poison that my full poison strategy occasionally meant watching my opponent heal much faster than I\u00a0could do damage.\u00a0 Excellent game!",
      "This game was my jam (and honey)!\u00a0 I loved it!\u00a0 Seriously, probably my favorite game in the jam so far.\u00a0 Loved the style (art, sounds, music, story, etc).\u00a0 It was all so polished.\u00a0 And the battling was really fun.\u00a0 I only won 3 of the games, but I still loved it.\u00a0 I expect this to be in the winner's circle and I want more of it!",
      "Absolutely great game that fits the challenges of the round. Loved the card game mechanics and picking the cards to use in the deck. Good improvements from the last round. Very fun, well done!",
      "I played a few times with different strategies, and each time I discovered new things. I think your game is awesome. The artwork is absolutely stunning and I especially love how the bees come at the end, and the little tail wag from the dog is just adorable. The polished feel and the ability to play against other players setups is totally amazing.\u00a0This is definitely one of my favourites of the jam",
      "What a\u00a0masterpiece!\u00a0I\u00a0can\u00a0definitely\u00a0see\u00a0myself\u00a0playing\u00a0more\u00a0of\u00a0this,\u00a0good\u00a0job!",
      "Healing meta\u00a0OP,\u00a0pls\u00a0nerf\u00a0:D managed to\u00a0snag the first\u00a0place score\u00a0on the\u00a0arcade\u00a0leaderboards with\u00a0117 gold",
      "I\u00a0died a lot :)",
      "Do bees\u00a0count\u00a0as\u00a0bugs?",
      "People say that the sequel isn't as good. They lied. This was great! Everything I loved about the first game, plus extra mechanics. I also love the idea of taking people's previous builds and facing off against those. I bet some lucky player is excited for an easy victory against my builds lol.",
      "Great work improving your game! It's very polished and fun to play!Tho I was pretty bad at it this time :P",

      "I honestly don't what more to say other than... goddamn that's good",
      "The gameplay in this one is incredible. I didn't get to this in the first round. I'm going back to play it again after writing this\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0084 I'll try to get into the top 10.",
      "Already gave a lot of my thoughts so I'll make this brief. Having the hover over the cards was a really cool improvement, especially since it allows you to take a look at others' builds. I feel like healing was a little overpowered or at least just not fun to play or play against personally, I like poison a lot and healing directly countered that which is probably part of the reason I dislike it. I will almost certainly come back and try to top the leaderboards, great job!",
      "An incredible improvement from Round 1! I really enjoyed both the card and upgrade variety. All the visuals are fantastic, the music on point, and the gameplay is enjoyable to watch! I'm not sure how much strategy is involved in card selection, but overall you did great! I hope to see a full version of this game someday.",
      "I am enamored by the visuals of this game!",
      "This game makes me want to try all the synergies. I tried damage build and poison build but both did not get me to the top 10...",
      "Loved the game and story! The UI looks great and the art style is appealing. I feel like there's a slight balance issue. I can't cause significant damage to the enemy even though I'm using a lot of damage cards. So the best thing I can do is pick all shield and healing cards and wait for the bees to kill the enemy.",
      "Thank you for the awesome game, Loten. I loved it. It took me a lot of mental strength to prevent myself from playing it while I was supposed to be working on my own game!",
      "The art is great and the cutscenes are really cute. I am still a little confused with what is going on and most of the time I am just staring without knowing what to do. What is the bottom orange bar? Is that for the bees that come? Why? What are the 3 different numbers in the health bar. What are the 5 boxes under the names at the top? Is honey the gold? What does it mean when a card buffs for \u00e2\u0080\u009cone turn\u00e2\u0080\u009d? What is \u00e2\u0080\u009cone-turn\u00e2\u0080\u009d? There are lots of cards may be, some basics about the cards could be added in the game page. Also, I cannot tab-out of the auto-battle as it pauses as soon as the game loses focus. Maybe add an option to speed things up? Also, is it really multiplayer? When I see someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, is that a deck someone used? Is that someone online right now? Can I chat with them?",
      "Good Job!\u00a0I only had some enemies, that apparently had the strategy of only choosing healing cards so the bees take out the enemy. Still a great game!",
      "Why are there so many sad dog games in this round?"

      "I loved this game soo much! I don't usually play these types of games, but I loved the gameplay.",
      "I agree with comments below that progression feels a little slow. I wonder if the projectiles are locked behind some upgrade I did not get, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see them. How do I increase the quest level? Also, sometimes enemies spawn far away and it takes a while to even run into anyone, maybe add a minimap or some pointer towards where they are?",
      "I just\u00a0spent\u00a0waaaayyyy\u00a0too\u00a0much\u00a0time\u00a0laying\u00a0this...\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0good\u00a0way :)",
      "Very promising game ! I'm dying too fast, though )))",
      "Great story and images to go with it.\u00a0 Also, whoever did the voice narration did a awesome job - it sounded fantastic!\u00a0 As for the actual gameplay, I am so impressed with what you are creating here.\u00a0 It feels like most of us are creating tiny little games for the jam, but you are at the beginning of something truly epic.\u00a0 I'm really impressed with what you've packed in already and can't wait to see what you do with it next.",
      "I have to say I REALLY loved the story.\u00a0 When I saw 4-5 minutes for the intro I was gonna skip immediately but it really dragged me in!\u00a0 The game is also very good, though I'll agree with some of the other comments that the size of the skill tree is pretty intimidating.\u00a0 Rating a game jam game it's always hard to feel like there's more game than I have time to experience.\u00a0 What I did experience is really solid, though!\u00a0 Good job!",
      "seemed a bit much for a game jam...just feel like if you maybe if you made it shorter with faster progression. that tree im assuming skills tree at the beginning was super intimidating\u00a0\u00a0and the story was to long to watch all the way through which you do warn at the start that it was long. it just feels like you missed the most of the objectives just by over doing not necessarily a bad thing but i cant even judge this game because simply who has the time when there is 60 other games to play..",
      "I wanted to\u00a0play\u00a0more, but\u00a0the\u00a0progression\u00a0feels\u00a0sloooow.\u00a0Anyway,\u00a0pretty\u00a0good gameplay\u00a0and\u00a0upgrades!",
      "The updates from last round are all good, but there's still too much for me to be able to make it far in this. I spent about 45 minutes and upgraded a lot but I have to move on.",
      "I really love the premise and the story and would totally want to see this being continued so hers a few issues I had;",
      "The visuals for the intro cutscene are excellent!",
      "Who did the voice acting? Is it AI or did you hire a professional?",
      "Once again, a great game! I\u00a0wish that you could upgrade things a little faster though. With such a large skill tree, I'd have to play for hours to get any significant upgrades. The story, which was great btw, was a little too long to be right at the beginning imo. I think if you put one scene every time the player returns to the tower, it would both encourage longer play sessions, and make the story more interesting since you're playing through parts of the story."

      "Well done :) I really enjoyed this.",
      "This is a gorgeous looking game; such an incredible upgrade from the first round.\nSmall comment, when I was in front of the lever and the drawbridge, the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccage\u00e2\u0080\u009d was not evident to me. There is some box at the other end of the room and I tried shooting at that, hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the \u00e2\u0080\u009cother cage\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the air.",
      "This looks great & the story had my interest. It felt like you were just getting started and I'd love to see more.\u00a0You've hit the projectile and animal criteria right on. The bow feels wonderful to shoot.",
      "Damn!\u00a0 That was incredible!\u00a0 Seriously, I dream of making something that good looking one day.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't believe how well it played in the web browser too.\u00a0 Obviously, it still has some work to do: sounds, music, enemy ai.\u00a0 But, what you have so far is terrific.\u00a0 This better move on, because I want to play more of it.",
      "Just great! Looking\u00a0forward\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0full\u00a0game\u00a0if\u00a0keep\u00a0working\u00a0on this\u00a0<3",
      "First of all the environment and visuals are AMAZING. The visual style is so clean and pretty and the lighting was done very well too. I think that the requirements were addressed very well, the animal was fun and cute and the projectiles were also useful. I found the story interesting but it led me more to want more of the story rather than feeling like a complete narrative. This is an issue I have with several of the games continued from round 1 just because they weren't built initially with a story in mind. I liked the skill tree from round 1 and was a little bit sad it wasn't present, but I still enjoyed the combat more even if it was just the cooler enemies and fun ragdolls. I may have imagined you saying that there were going to be drop assassinations but I think that would be incredibly cool. I still dropped down on enemies to attack them anyway and that was pretty fun. I wish that the bow was a bit more useful for combat as it felt significantly worse than the dagger even if it just had no knockback. With the daggers knockback you weren't really punished for getting close to enemies anyway so there was no reason to stay far away.\u00a0Overall, amazing job, hope you continue work. (:",
      "I wish this game\u00a0had audio\u00a0:D\u00a0it's very enjoyable,\u00a0love the artstyle and while\u00a0the gameplay\u00a0is\u00a0a bit\u00a0basic at the\u00a0moment, it\u00a0has so much potential. But I'm a sucker for first person games like this, so don't listen to my complaints :D  Storytelling was nicely done even without audio. Good stuff!",
      "Very well done! I loved everything about this game. I think you nailed the task and all the required\u00a0extras, well done!",
      "I still remember your first version of the game and while it was more like an alpha build, this felt like an actual demo. I'm impressed how you managed to build this good-looking and -feeling\u00a03D-game\u00a0in the given\u00a0time window. The story was also interesting and dark, the crow is awesome and I kinda want to know more about what had happened.",
      "Was great\u00a0to\u00a0play\u00a0on\u00a0stream! Thanks for\u00a0submitting, and sorry for the timezone! Please feel\u00a0free\u00a0to\u00a0watch for comments\u00a0there (around 02:00:06)",
      "I love the outlines on the 3d models, this game has a very distinct style that i love, great job this feels like am entirely diffrent game than r1",
      "The story and visuals are amazing. I completed the game 2 times to make sure I didn't miss anything. I didn't find a way through the locked doors so I might have done though. I thought the key would have been past the rafters but it wasn't but I liked exploring the levels.\u00a0It's cool how you can jump on the chandelier, crawl through gaps and use a bow and arrow to shoot skeletons with and that last guy looks incredible!",
      "This is a fine entry that takes on all three of round 2 conditions without holding back on any. It was enjoyable sneaking around and trying to gather pieces of the story. Btw that's some high quality outline shader as far as I can tell (I'm not very knowledgable on shaders)\u00a0is it or code it is based on available online?",
      "amazing graphics and atmosphere, by far my favorite part. looking forward to future updates if there are any planned.\u00a0great submission!",
      "I am surprised it is running in my browser\u00a0:D great job on performance optimizations!",
      "Stone Seeker 2 crow is my new best friend.",
      "Perfect game for me! Especially loved the visuals and the secrets :P",
      "My guys out here making a game with AAA graphics for this game jam. Fighting mechanics really solid (sword and bow), the platforming felt nice as well. I had to really pay attention to the subtitles with the lack of sound but I can understand and see where most of your time went whilst making this submission. Honestly feels like if you fleshed it out you could have something truly special on your hands here. Keep going! I want to see where you take this in the later rounds.",
      "",
      "Great game with amazing visuals and an interesting story! I like that the game is a flashback and the ending links back to the start. The battles felt a little dull since you can't take damage at the moment, and the game is a little heavy to run in the browser.",
      "I love crows so damn much. It's always nice to see a 3D Project in a Game Jam. I had a small issue with the bow, it sometime would hit the skeleton and not deal damage. It would've been nice to see the coins and potions end up doing something, but I assume there are plans for Round 3. It's overall a great start the I really look forward too!",

      "Visuals are really cool. This remind me of the good old time of rail shooters. Did not fully understood the dialog at the beginning and a bit too much of story at the beginning. But overall very fun idea, curious to see more !",
      "I love rats but not these one! Fun game!",
      "I absolutely love rail shooters. \u00a0Once we got into the game, this was really fun.\u00a0 As others have mentioned, the scroll is too long, but that's an easy fix. \u00a0Definitely keep it - it has a cool retro vibe (just tighten it). \u00a0Also,\u00a0I dig the narration, but I did have a little trouble understanding all the words, maybe have a \"subtitle\" option.\u00a0 But the main part of the game, the shooting was so much fun and took me back to some of my favorite old games. \u00a0One last thing, my images don't look like your included screenshots.\u00a0\u00a0They all felt a little washed out and grey.\u00a0\u00a0I am on an Apple laptop and tried it on Safari and Chrome.\u00a0 \u00a0I am attaching an image so you can see what\u00a0I mean.",
      "Very cool rail\u00a0shooter",
      "This game looks really nice. I think this could become great with a couple tweaks and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see more. A couple comments:",
      "A lot of people have mentioned wanting to move faster through the story but I actually didn't think the scroll was necessary. With the cutscene at the start and a few more clues maybe spread throughout I think it'd be more interesting to piece together the story yourself. I've never played a game of this genre before but I thought it was pretty cool.\u00a0There wasn't much variety but I think the length was just right and it didn't drag on. I also appreciated the visuals although I think the UI could use some more love. I think the criteria were addressed solidly and that they came together pretty nicely. Overall, well done!",
      "I\u00a0really enjoyed this. The 'on rails shooter' genre doesn't get enough love. Good Job!",
      "Love the silly\u00a0one-liners\u00a0:D",
      "A cool synthwave-supported intro leads us into a game that might have been a doomed side experiment\u00a0of some legendary director such as Paul Verhoeven\u00a0that got canned early in development and so it feels like a leaked relic for collector's delight. The shooting is actually fun, and I wouldn't mind if you artificially prolonged it, though giving the ability to replay is nice as well. I\u00a0get this project was more ambitious than what it might seem so\u00a0you were pressed for time, still an impressive amount is achieved. While the narrative is presented only in intro, the game has enough traces of it contained within itself (the voiceover and the setting with rats) that it shouldn't be much of a problem.",
      "Loved the story and the sounds.",
      "I think I'm giving this game top marks because everything worked together real smooth and it was bug free for my playthrough. I wish there was more because I\u00a0really liked the gameplay. Great game!",

I appreciate you giving the ability to quickly replay the level after completing it. It was fun to replay and get 100% accuracy. Can't forget the voice clips that play after every section too! Really added some extra life to the game. Overall extremely impressive game!(Also, rat buddies!!)",
      "I finished the game and loved the inspirations behind it. Your game is a ton of fun. and\u00a0I really hope you continue development because it's fantastic! Here are a few suggestions to make it even better: The bullet text was a bit cut off and\u00a0perhaps an image of the six bullets would look nicer.  Being able to adjust the story text scroll speed with the left and right mouse buttons would be great.  Headshots could one-hit kill rats, and maybe add some interactive background elements just for fun when not busy killing rats.  Great job on this one!",
      "",
      "Great story with very cool visuals! This type of shooting game gives me a lot of nostalgia. The voiceover in the cutscene is a little bit too muffled and hard to understand.",
      "Really cool! I love the dithering effect, and the PSX style shader on the rats. The voice acting was a nice touch.",
      "The intro scene took a bit too long, the black screen took forever.",

      "Rare genre you have there!\u00a0The world needs more rail shooters, I think.",
      "A cool idea! I loved the story at the beginning, but my voice lines once I got to the facility were glitched and kept cutting themselves off. Overall the gameplay and atmosphere were so cool though! Made me feel like I was in an arcade."

      "Very cute cat sprite and animation. Animation before the jump is adorable!",
      "Adorable story at the beginning with great images.\u00a0 I like this cat and I want to save this bird, but jumping is really hard and I'm terrible at it.\u00a0 I kept missing the platforms, falling\u00a0 down, and having to start all over again.\u00a0 I wish there was an easy mode.\u00a0\u00a0I would love to see someone better than me play this game, as I would love to see the ending.",
      "I love the art style. The AI narration was a bit jarring for me but other than that I really loved the story slides in the intro and the ending. You did a really great job setting up the relationship between the cat and his bird friend.",
      "I really liked your art and style on this one!\u00a0 The jump mechanic was a lot of fun but also a little hard to control.\u00a0 I'd recommend maybe showing more of the trajectory or having the trajectory oscillate instead of just increasing so that you can still make a jump even if you mess up a little at first.\u00a0 I also think it can be a little risky with the criteria to have a \"projectile like jump\" and use an animal as the main character, but that's more of GDKO technicality advice for next round.\u00a0 This was a great game overall though!",
      "First of all, the cat is really cute. The jumping took a bit to get used to and even once I did the aiming felt a bit slow. The story was cute and I can't help but notice that our good/evil bird designs look incredibly similar.\u00a0Great minds think alike I guess. I found the difficulty to be a bit hard, and combined with the fact that there are no changes to the map or indicator of how high you are I had to stop playing. I may come back to finish this to get the full experience but I'd like to rate as many games as possible so I don't have the time for that at the moment. Bouncing off of walls was kind of annoying but I grew to like it, however I feel like it may have been a bit much and the incredibly high amount of sliding you do after bouncing off a wall versus landing squarely otherwise felt a bit unintuitive. The intro at the start was very cute and a good way of communicating the story although the voicelines felt a bit dissonant with the tone of the game. Overall, I enjoyed playing it, well done!",
      "The jumping was interesting and took me some time to get used to. Fun game.",
      "Very jump king energy. I liked it! Well done",
      "Love the opening intro! Though I think it would be better without the voice to go with it. Its a bit dissonant with the tone of the cutscene and the other sounds/visuals.",
      "Awesome cinematic intro, got me invested! Well done!",
      "The cat's sprite is so ungodly cute.\u00a0The movement felt a bit\u00a0rough around the edges, but regardless the art is so good I don't even care.",
      "Very fun but tricky game. Good Job.",

      "This was a good entry!\u00a0 Solid little game, and you did a good job adding in the elements for the round.\u00a0One tweak I'd recommend would be to slow down the fire rate for the stun gun a bit, since if you got hit once it was really easy to get stuck for a long time.\u00a0 One other thing I'd recommend just for rating purposes is to have the projectiles and animal show up earlier in the game.\u00a0 In a jam like this there's always a chance that someone isn't good enough at your game to reach the boss fight, so someone could get partway through and think \"I didn't see any animals\" and dock you points.\u00a0 Great game overall though!",
      "The game itself was really good, the platforming mechanics were awesome and it felt awesome to play. Got into a real flow state jumping up the map and you nailed the main game loop. I didn't come across any bugs during my playthrough. You had a story and you added in a cool animal boss fight at the end. No real criticism other than some of the sounds were a little loud for headphone users, you could maybe look at tweaking them and making sure the main game music is at the same level of loudness as the boss fight, it made me jump! Overall you did a great job. Well done!",
      "This was one of my fav entries from round 1. But I am not sure if it very well aligned with the criterias as much as I would have wanted it to be especially with the projectile, although it is somewhat aligned. And yes this game is free from bugs (at least I did not come across any). Escaping the lava was fun !",
      "Good additions to the game from the last round. I\u00a0appreciate the space to jump as well as the w. Fun game with a story. The projectiles and animal were all there, good work!",
      "Love to see this project working its way through the ranks! I appreciated the ability to read through the story elements at my own pace. The platforming has come a long way since last round\u00a0as well! Can't wait to see what's next for you.",
      "That was a fun. I think you've a got in interesting idea overall.",
      "The platforming feels good, but I'm getting a lot of lag hitches when playing it in my browser that makes me miss some jumps.",
      "Ah, I remember playing this in the first round. What a fantastic improvement! I absolutely adore the extended game loop of managing your moveable platform, whilst trying to outrun the rising lava. The enemies didn't add all that much, but the boss fight at the end was fairly fun! I understand why you made a big text wall, considering I did almost the same thing, but it's still makes the story feel rushed. You did fantastic!",
      "This was fun. The platforming felt good although I never really felt like the lava was a threat. The story felt a bit shoved into the game as it was just a lot of text at the start which\u00a0I decided to skip halfway through. I'm assuming the boss was the animal but there was nothing really 'animal' about it.\u00a0I also didn't really like the boss because it didn't really align with the games mechanics, like the platforming, and it took me two minutes to realize I had to touch it to deal damage as touching enemies is actively discourage in the game. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, well done.",
      "Fun game\u00a0but\u00a0I\u00a0couldnt\u00a0play\u00a0more\u00a0because\u00a0it crashes my\u00a0browser\u00a0HARD\u00a0in\u00a0less\u00a0than\u00a0a\u00a0minute.

      "pretty cool platforming, i think you should focus more on visuals but thats a nitpick, also it doesnt effect the round criteria",
      "The platforming were already good during they first round but I feel like the threat of lava really added something to it. At first I thought lava was rising too slowly and didn't really care about it, but at the end I failed a little and\u00a0was panicking that it would get me. I also like your character art.",
      "The platforming feels great. I made it all the way to the end\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0081",
      "First, I love to see other C3 Programmers in the Jam!",
      "This was a fun platformer! I wish it didn't lag so much so that I\u00a0could finish the story. Once I\u00a0got to level 4, I couldn't continue because of the lag."

      "decently fun game to play.\u00a0 not for sure the point of the dog other than to say you put an animal in your game. the was no narrative that i came across in the five mins of play. couldn't find instructions on how to play therefore i couldn't figure out what the symbols on the bottom screen was for...maybe a bit of a story to explain why stars are chasing after me and the ghost dog. honestly thought that maybe the dog would heal me if stand next it but it didnt",

The art style was really cute, and having my poor ghost pooch follow me around was enough to show me the narrative. The game over screen in particular was very well done, epic effect. Good job (:",

I reloaded it a few times, but I was not making any progress. Might come back after I'm done playing and rating the rest. Good work, there's a lot in here, might just need some better tutorials and building descriptions.",
      "I'll be honest, I\u00a0don't think I'm the intended audience for this game. I\u00a0can't understand what's going on, even after reading the pdf. I think a more hands on tutorial is needed for this game. As it is, I'm going to try to rate fairly, but I\u00a0honestly can't tell what the game is about.",

      "Cool concept, very unique. I think the addition, that the enemy attack is an actual minigame, which influences the game is great. The visuals are something you need to work on, because the pixel density is not the same on the whole screen, this looks a bit weird. Some pixels are bigger than others, and then there are circles which arent pixelated at all. Make it consistent everywhere and it'll look better with not much effort. Still a great entry, good job!",

I\u00a0think 50 health for 1 enemy is probably good, but when 3 enemies have 50 health and my whole team combined has 30, it feels like I'm at a disadvantage. Even with a disadvantage, that's fine, but I felt like I\u00a0wanted more ways to solve that problem than \"reroll stats\"",

      "It was good to see how much you had worked on this from round 1 to round 2, it's coming along nicely. The first level I felt was pretty much perfect, just the right level of difficulty.\u00a0 The second level felt a bit more unfair, mainly because of how far back the spawn point takes you, it takes a little while to get back into the action and it feels a bit discouraging because once you know how to navigate those first obstacles it becomes more of a chore than fun. The story elements were done very well and overall an impressive and enjoyable game. Great job!",
      "Tried this with my 6 yo grandkid. Level 1 was perfect. Level 2 we got stuck on trying to get to the first duckling...",
      "A cure creative game that was fun. Surprisingly not the only \"birds as projectiles\" game in the round. Good work!",
      "What a cute game! I\u00a0was a little confused why the ducklings couldn't launch through things when I could. It took me a long time to realize the intended solution to return to the nest on level 2.",
      "Now the controls are\u00a0excellent!\u00a0Good\u00a0job!",
      "I played this in the first round and it's great to see how much more you've managed to add into the game since then. You stuck to the tasks criteria and created something fun. Great job!",
      "Very well done.\u00a0The story was heartfelt and enjoyable and the book was a nice touch. I wish the text showed up a bit faster or there was an option to skip the animation, I almost skipped the story because I get easily annoyed by slow text (but\u00a0I'm very glad I stuck with it.) The mechanics were really fun and I had a great time playing. You mention not having time to finish the final level at the end but I wish you hadn't, I felt like I had just had a full experience and that just made me consider what was missing rather than enjoying what was there.\u00a0Overall, very well done, great evolution from round 1.",
      "WOAH this is so much more polished than r1 loved it good job!",
      "The storytelling in the book was excellent. I enjoyed the challenge of getting all the ducklings to the nest and I made it to the turbo rocket level. While I found it a bit frustrating to be sent all the way back to the nest after touching certain objects, the movement itself felt great",
      "What a heartwarming and funny story! I really like the pool table-like projectiles mechanic. The rocket mechanics are also pretty fun.",
      "Ohhh my goodness!This has to be my favorite evolution of game concept from Round 1 to 2!!!This story had me sooooo emotional, and thats not even mentioning the great mechanics this time round. Terrific job",
      "Had a great time throwing my ducks around! very nice touch with the book to tell the story. great job",
      "A cute and silly game. You covered all of the criteria well. Minor nitpick is that I wish the text moved a little faster. I would not mind seeing more of this game in future rounds, felt like it was just getting started and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering what kind of puzzles/levels you had in mind. Great job."

      "Good atmosphere and an interesting narrative.\u00a0\u00a0Got a bit bored looking for the flowers, it took a really long time. Other than that, the monster popping up from time to time was great and the game was bug free for me. Well done!",
      "It was\u00a0pretty\u00a0hard\u00a0to\u00a0find\u00a0those\u00a0flowers in the dark,\u00a0maybe\u00a0scattering them\u00a0more\u00a0would\u00a0help\u00a0the\u00a0pacing,\u00a0unless\u00a0it was\u00a0intentional...By the\u00a0way,\u00a0never\u00a0found any\u00a0monsters,\u00a0I was\u00a0prepared\u00a0for a\u00a0jump scare\u00a0haha",
      "I love horror games and was impressed with how well you created an atmosphere. The story was intriguing and good job on the voice acting. The flowers were very difficult to find but that only added to my sense of dread for when the monster eventually got me. The environment was spooky and I think overall you did a very good job. As someone mentioned in the comments below the only real criticism I have was trying to find those damned flowers, I think if you find a way to make them easier to find, you will keep the player more engaged for longer. I think it probably was a design choice on your part to force the player to search them out whilst being worried about the monster, I just think it needs tweaking somehow. Well done!",
      "This is a cool concept!\u00a0I think the issue with the lighting make the game almost unplayable. It would really benefit the game a lot if the flowers you're looking for (which are tiny and blend into the environment too much) had a dim light around them to make it easier to see. Same thing with the enemy. It blends in so much that I\u00a0couldn't see it to shoot until it was too late.",
      "The first time I played this, I accidentally press shoot instantly after the game begun and ended up shooting the dog :') For a while I was all like, \"OH NO I'M THE MURDERER\", but after I restarted I realized it was just me spamming the left mouse button a little too aggressively.",
      "I sadly did not finish it. I forced myself to get the first 3 flowers (the last one I accidentally got while moving from the monster), but when I found out there was more aimless searching to be done I gave up.I liked the intro and the voice acting adds character, but I didn't feel that the fact Maverick was an animal influenced the story, Maverick could've just as well been your grandpa and the story (from what I've seen) would've still worked.",

      "Really fun and addicting, given some more time and polish, this could easily be one of my favorite puzzle games. Well done!",

      "This was my first time trying this game, and I really enjoyed your unique take on the block puzzle game. Even as a prototype the mechanics and presentation are so polished! I had some difficulty adjusting to the controls but that became easier the more I played. Would love to see where this goes!",
      "The cutscene was excellent, really well done there! The block eating/spitting mechanic was a lot of fun, and it was cool how many blocks you could eat.\u00a0I instantly knew how to play the game and the visuals were great.\u00a0I appreciate the ambition of the 4-directional eating ability, and it's technically impressive. However, it made the game feel more complex, and I encountered some out-of-bounds problems with overlapping blocks.  I wonder if a 2-directional system would be better in some ways perhaps",
      "The intro is really cute and the platforming was very fun. The visuals and pixelart are incredibly charming and fun. I think that the feedback for blocks being destroyed could have been a little bit faster and also generally spent a lot of time kind of confused. I wish there was a better way to get out of being buried. The mechanics and ideas are really interesting. Not exactly sure what the projectiles are, maybe spitting out the blocks but they didn't really behave that way. I think the story was cute and the animal was a great addition.\u00a0There were definitely a multitude of bugs, not enough to make it unplayable but I experienced a lot of stuff clipping out of the map and vibrating blocks. The game was still playable and fun, though, and I love how original the mechanics are. I think having W and up arrow be options for jumping would have been nice too, as directional inputs were already being provided and I would rather use that than another key to remember in addition. Overall, the game was very polished and cute, well done!",
      "I'm glad that you get a wild card in the first round!",
      "I really like the visual aspect of this game! The cutscene at the start, the animations of the gameplay, and just every bit of art looks great! The music was really loud on launch, but It was easily fixable in the settings. The game loop is super fun! I'd love to see different difficulty options, along side a ramping difficulty curve as the game goes on. Great work!",
      "Love the concept! I\u00a0found a few bugs, most notably you can shoot a block through another block to clip the edge of the level. I would also love A\u00a0better way to un-dig myself from being buried. Maybe if I\u00a0could eat and swallow a block instead of having to shoot it? idk, but super fun vibes!",
      "W cutscenelove the gameplaygreat work man!",
      "The intro is great and some aspects from the round 1 submission\u00a0are more polished now. I wish you will be able to add dying\u00a0at\u00a0some point so this can really become an intense survival minigame.",
      "Cute start intro, very nice art!",
      "Very cool cutscene. Great art. I liked the round 1 submission and I was looking forward to seeing how it would evolve. I did run into a couple bugs, one is that I was spitting blocks but those were going stacking or somemthing and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything. I also got trapped between blocks and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat nor get out. I think the speed is a little too fast, maybe introduce the game at a lower speed first."

      "Very nice graphics and colors. Liked the simple sounds and gameplay.",
      "Cute scarecrow! Very neat game\u00a0)",
      "I love crows so much. The game could definitely use more enemy variation and later in the game I'd just get hit by an enemy before I could see there was an enemy on screen, but it was a minor issue. The ability to increase crit chance and crit damage is something you don't see that often in Jams, but incredibly welcome. Although, no amount of gameplay can extinguish my joy upon seeing crows.",
      "Dude you really nailed this one!\u00a0 From the title to the intro art and story, to the gameplay being fun enough that I kept playing well past the point of knowing how I'd rate it, that's a full five stars from me!",
      "Very neat :)",
      "I loved this game!\u00a0First, you have my favorite game title (I love that a bunch of crows are called a murder).\u00a0 Second, I\u00a0really dug the opening cut scene.\u00a0\u00a0Third, and most importantly, it was just really fun to play. I love the mechanics of it (shooting out my crows) and the upgrades were awesome (I really looked forward to those).\u00a0 If I'm being nit-picky,\u00a0I think there could have been a little more story, but\u00a0I still loved it as is.\u00a0 And, for a brief moment (I assume), I made it to 10th on the leader board - I was very proud.\u00a0 This is a winner and I really hope you get to continue it and I can play it again!",
      "The game mechanics were there for the challenge of the round. I would have enjoyed a more finished game, but that's not what we're judging here. It was addicting and fun, well done!",
      "Using the mouse, the arrow keys/WASD and space at the same time is kinda awkward. maybe better to auto shoot or auto aim so you either do not have to use the space bar or the mouse.",
      "This was great! I would have loved an alternative to the spacebar, since the main strategy is just hold space and dodge. Otherwise, the theme, the upgrades. Everything was great!",
      "Pretty enjoyable game! The story feels\u00a0a bit weak but it\u00a0helps\u00a0setting the mood.\u00a0Gameplay was fun,\u00a0except for the holding\u00a0down spacebar\u00a0part :')",
      "Pretty fun!\u00a0I\u00a0wish\u00a0I\u00a0could\u00a0play\u00a0more\u00a0but\u00a0holding\u00a0spacebar\u00a0all the\u00a0time\u00a0makes\u00a0my\u00a0wrist\u00a0hurt\u00a0:(",
      "This is my favorite submission of yours so far! It had a really fun gameplay loop, and I loved all the upgrades, especially crow storm and the homing upgrade.",
      "Feels likes Vampire Survivors! I liked this one. Kept my brain engaged the whole time. You could expand this in a lot of fun ways. You've got the animal and projectile down perfectly.",
      "I had a lot of fun with this game! I think having shoot bound to the mouse would have been better. I initially assumed there were only stat buff upgrades from the first few I was offered but was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the variety available.\u00a0 Combining the projectiles with the animals was a sneaky devious move that in my opinion definitely made the whole game more cohesive. I wish the enemies had a bit more contrast with the ground as generally for me when playing video games (and this is ameproblem) I tunnel vision into very specific things. This meant that while chasing one enemy I just wouldn't process the other one or multiple heading towards me, and I think if their color had been a bit brighter and if the grass didn't render on top of them that might have resolved the issue. This was a ton of fun, and I'll probably come back to this later to attempt to get a better score. Well done!",
      "I found it frustrating that the space bar was the shoot button, and it made me bind it to my mouse instead \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085. I really enjoyed the upgrade system with its many great options. It feels like you have the bare bones of something great here, and I can tell the game wants to be something more, but it seems like you just didn't have enough time. For what it is, I really enjoyed playing it, and I would love to see this continued in a future round.",
      "Simple, yet fun and addictive!The intro cutscene is also really great!",
      "It felt like a GBC game from back in the day. I'm not overly great at games like this but can see how you could get addicted to the game loop very quickly. Sound was awesome. Didn't encounter any bugs and the story was clear from the outset. I liked how you killed two crows (sorry) with one stone with regards to this rounds task, combining both the projectile and animal into one. Cool game. Well done!",
      "Great cutscene! I've already played your game three times already and keep improving my score, will definitely come back for more.  The upgrade system is a fantastic addition, especially the homing crow and the options you give made me experiment with a few different strategies.\u00a0Two suggestions,\u00a0mouse button for shooting would feel more intuitive to me and I can tell you had a plan for a character for the green squares but for me personally the green blends too much with the background",

      "A REALLY polished and well thought out platformer. My only real complaint is the Boss Fight, but that might be more of a me problem, as I can't put into words why I didn't care for it. I also wish you could kill more of the enemies. The birds being the only killable enemy made some levels feel less interesting than the could've been. Regardless,\u00a0\u00a0the art is so fun to look at, and the audio is really nice! The only feedback I can give is to have a better icon for the game itself lol.",
      "Really liked this game. I fell off the map on one level and I\u00a0have to move on because I don't want to play through them again at the moment. That doesn't really affect my rating, just a bummer for me. You got a good story, good projectiles, and animals. The puzzles are fun and challenging. Great work! I'll try to get back to finish game.",
      "Really cool intro and in general the vibe is fun and light!",
      "my reflex is bad glad you included the video. Reminded me of a game called Dave I used to play. Loved it. You even had a boss fight. Great work!",
      "I won!",
      "Damn this is definitely one of my favorites from the jam so far. Great storytelling, great projectile mechanic, fun platforming,\u00a0animals, great work!",
      "Rage inducing yet still fun. I think the difficulty was a bit high, and I also felt like the levels felt a bit all over the place in terms of difficulty without a clear curve. There were a few points when you could leave the map and the controls were a bit finnicky. I liked the shader and the simple art style. Overall, well done!",
      "",
      "I CRIEDwhen they stole my,MY NUT, REALLY COOL PLATFORMER LOVED THE SIMPLE ONE ROOM CONCEPT!im still angry they stole my nut... got to the boss but couldnt beat it so idk if theres a super plotwist in the ending cutscene or not sorry",
      "Love it so far, the tusk aim is brilliant example of shaping the game by your character concept,\u00a0and it was ecstatic to finally figure out how to solve that level with\u00a02x2 turrets lined up in the middle (actually that was the most challenging level yet even though it appears early on, and I only got the clue by accident). However in the first level with legionnaire squirrels I\u00a0went through the wall and there was no reset, kind of a bummer as it takes a while to get to that point, I'll prob retry later when I have more time. Real good work.",
      "Stellar gameplay! The mechanics are so simple yet so meticulous, and all the levels are extremely clever!",
      "This game is awesome and I've just spent the last 30 minutes trying to beat it but I had to give up before I throw my keyboard at the screen. Loved the NES style graphics and animations and as a whole this makes for a really fun experience. The level design was great. My one and only criticism of this game is the damn control scheme (I'm not a PC gamer, I normally play with controller so this is probably part of the problem). Other than that, which is probably a skill issue, this game was 5*. Oh and that chiptune in the background is absolutely funky as hell and I'm all for it. Awesome job dude!",
      "Great game, I love the art style and the multi-purpose design of the projectile mechanic!",

The music adds a nice touch, although the SFX gets a little annoying in the later levels.\u00a0 The turret variations are all really fun and force you to approach each obstacle slightly different. Fantastic work!",

      "Really interesting idea that I'm surprised I haven't seen done before. I thought it was really cool although maybe a bit slow/repetitive for my taste. I think that the difficulty was kind of weird as for any given level it would just be hardest at the points were you are closest to a turret, it might be better to have it slowly increase. The art was cute and the difficulty levels were a nice addition. The projectiles and animals worked together very well but I do wish the story had been integrated a bit further. Overall, nicely done!",

      "Really like\u00a0the story,\u00a0keeps\u00a0you\u00a0real\u00a0intrigued!The sound\u00a0aspect\u00a0could\u00a0do\u00a0with\u00a0some\u00a0work\u00a0though, a lot\u00a0of the\u00a0unexpected\u00a0contact sound effects\u00a0and constant static\u00a0was\u00a0kinda\u00a0disorienting.",
      "Super satisfying physics gameplay. The sound effects really bring it all together for me.",
      "I enjoyed it but no matter what\u00a0I couldn't escape..",
      "I love golf games and this was really fun.\u00a0 I'm not sure why, but on my Apple laptop (both in Safari and Chrome) the game would only fill up 1/4 of the screen (even if I zoomed in).\u00a0 It was still playable though and a fun challenge.\u00a0 I love when the golf ball started to have it's own identity and thoughts.\u00a0 Really clever and original.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you get to continue this.",
      "This was a really cool game.\u00a0Making the game become meta and break down was an interesting choice that left me unsure if some of the bugs I experienced were intentional? I couldn't fullscreen which I assume was unintentional, although it *SPOILERS* caused me to try and refresh the game to see if it would fix the issue\u00a0after I couldn't figure out how to escape. I wanted to try and read some text I couldn't see when it was small but then I realized what it meant by the true start of the game and proceeded directly off. I don't know if the audio was supposed to break down into buzzing a few minutes into my playthrough but that was unpleasant. I really liked the simple visuals and the shader for the clues or whatever looked incredibly cool. I was actually having a lot of fun even with just the mini golf. I didn't see any animals but I'm assuming I just missed them. Maybe a video of a whole actual playthrough would be nice to tell which bugs may or may not be intentional and how the game is actually meant to end. I still had a great time and think that it did a great job with some criteria just not others. Nicely done!",
      "Really liked the minigolf mixed with the existential dread of the golf ball. Really fun game.",
      "This is, so far, my second favorite game in the entirety of Round 2! I love golfing games, and creepy imagery, so this game couldn't be more perfect! The controls were a little hard to use at first, but after I got the hand of it, I did another 5ish runs. My best run was 8 total shots! It's hard to say anything other than, THIS IS AN AWSOME GAME.",
      "I\u00a0always enjoy a good mini golf game :) Well done.",
      "Very good, I cant\u00a0escape\u00a0though\u00a0:(",
      "Nice game with a great creepy vibe! I keep getting surprised.\u00a0I still can't find the way out - I found the hidden path and thought that was it, but I still get reset after falling off the mini golf track. Maybe add more hints for how to progress the story.",
      "Interesting!\u00a0A\u00a0kind of analog horror twist on\u00a0golf\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0super\u00a0cool\u00a0idea and the\u00a0narrative components\u00a0with the dialog and the\u00a0cool\u00a0effects\u00a0and hidden\u00a0messages\u00a0is a\u00a0great vibe.

I think there is something super special in that concept.Great\u00a0job!",
      "I only managed 13. Loved the creepy plot twist and the rewind shot ability was cool. A couple audio bugs but other than a fun game. Nice work!",
      "I got 12\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0081 I love golf games, this was great. I\u00a0liked how precisely you can hit the ball. I think golf fits 'projectile' perfectly and you had the animal narrator with the surprise twist.",
      "I\u00a0was worried that there wouldn't be a story, until I\u00a0got to the end. I\u00a0got legitimate chills. Great job! I\u00a0hope you figure out that issue with the window. I'd love to play a fullscreen version!"

      "A cute game! I liked it!",
      "This was really good!\u00a0 I liked the story and mechanics.\u00a0 One nitpicky thing is that\u00a0 throwing the bone onto the switch meant the dog hit the bone and stopped before the switch.\u00a0 Having the dog be in the same spot as the bone after eating the bone would make the puzzle a little more intuitive.\u00a0 Overall great job though!",
      "Impressive for\u00a010\u00a0hours! The\u00a0aiming\u00a0felt\u00a0a\u00a0bit\u00a0odd\u00a0at\u00a0first\u00a0but\u00a0I\u00a0got\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0it.\u00a0Funny mechanic\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0competing girl that is\u00a0scared\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0dog.\u00a0Well\u00a0done!",
      "found it difficult to throw the bone on the weight activated thing without the dog catching it\u00a0. I\u00a0mean I guess i could've gotten separation from the dog first but that required running the dog into a wall while I'm still moving just extremely frustrating mechanics. but did fit the criteria i guess you did have an animal...you did have a projectile although your animal refused to let land where i needed it to and it did have a story.",
      "I love the hand-drawn look and the interaction between our character and Meep is great.\u00a0 Meep is indeed a good boy.\u00a0 I'm afraid I\u00a0wasn't very good at the game, but I found it all very charming none-the-less.\u00a0\u00a0Well done and actually very impressive for 10 hours.",
      "Pretty fun concept!\u00a0One of the few games I've seen where the intro text\u00a0is a bit too fast\u00a0:D",
      "Great game for only 10h. Meep would often not listen to me lol but that's to be expected within the time. I did a playthrough with max attraction to see what would happen and found the text funny",
      "Great work! I liked the story and I absolutely loved the art style. The platforming was sound, although the dog system and the attraction system could have used more time in the oven. Overall, I give it a B for 'Balentimes Day.' If the projectile throwing system and dog were improved that would move it up to a solid 'A' for 'Adorable.'",
      "Very impressive for only 10 hours work. You stuck to the criteria and I can't really argue with the results. Great job!",
      "For being made in 10 hours this was pretty good.\u00a0The dog felt a bit unwieldy, my main issues being having to go back and get it along with throwing a bone with them by me and it instantly disappearing. I also wished that meep, and in turn the animals and projectiles, had been used a bit more considering you only really needed it for that one button and can jump over the girls. I also think that having the camera ahead of the player was a good idea but it was a little too far ahead which made any situation in which you need to see or move back feel awkward. The story was cute and funny although I do maybe wish it made a little more sense than the girlfriend spreading treasure chests throughout the city. It was charming but it's also hard to connect with goofy stories and they should stay somewhat rooted in reality. I think this game did a good job addressing all of the different criteria, and well I don't think any of the elements it's being judged on\u00a0were done phenomenally I think that they worked well together and made a complete product, so good job!",
      "This was a fun, cute game. Made in 10 hours is pretty good. Loved the puzzles and I can really see this expanded on into something great. You got a good story, a fun projectile (much like in my game), an animal that helps you solve the puzzles, and a fun game. Good work!",
      "Fun game\u00a0especially\u00a0for\u00a0only\u00a0doing\u00a0it\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0hours.\u00a0It\u00a0was\u00a0actually\u00a0pretty\u00a0funny\u00a0and\u00a0wouldve\u00a0been\u00a0amazing\u00a0with\u00a0some\u00a0extra\u00a0puzzles.\u00a0Als\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0jump\u00a0on\u00a0platforms\u00a0your\u00a0dog\u00a0can get\u00a0stuck\u00a0and\u00a0stay\u00a0below\u00a0you,\u00a0this\u00a0awesome\u00a0feature\u00a0could\u00a0create\u00a0some\u00a0cool\u00a0puzzles.",

      "Cute story! It's impressive what you made in only 10 hours. The game is a little buggy unfortunately - sometimes throwing the bone had no response. You need to press jump and follow so Meep will jump with you, but sometimes Meep won't jump no matter what. Sometimes Meep jumps but falls weirdly slowly.",
      "I\u00a0initially was going to rate this game 0 stars, but then I read your very convincing pitch. 5 stars on everything now!",
      "Fun game! I love the mechanic of Pitandra being too enamored by doggo to seduct lol. genius"

      "Nice story addition to a very nice game.",
      "I remember really loving this from the first round.\u00a0\u00a0But, I was a little confused this time.\u00a0 I couldn't get past the first screen.\u00a0 I put squares all over the map and tried to highlight where I thought the mines were, but I guess I wasn't doing it right.\u00a0 I think with a slightly better tutorial, this would be awesome.",
      "Gotta say I\u00a0like this more in the context of a story than just a puzzle game. Well done.",
      "the is in ok state",
      "This was one of my favorites from round 1, but I'm not sure it was as well executed this time around. I wasn't able to make it past the third minefield as it was a vertical strip and I only had those horizontal items left over by that point. And then the game froze on me.\u00a0Which is a bummer because the idea has a ton of potential and you've already put in most of the ground work.",
      "I think I\u00a0understand the game? It's hard to tell because there's not much player feedback other than to door disappearing. A solid tutorial would bring this to the finish line in my opinion.\u00a0I love the idea, but for me, the execution just wasn't quite there. From reading the other comments, it sounds like there's a lot of unfinished parts, which is a bummer for the jam, but I'm super interested in what happens with this in the future!",
      "This was my favorite game during the first game so I'm glad you decided to explore the concept a little more. This is basically a puzzle mode with minesweeper and I'm surprised how well the story mode goes together with it.",
      "I'm already bad at minesweeper, but this game is so confusing to me. I swear I tried every way I could\u00a0to understand how to deal with the first tunnel, but I only get through on what seemed as random chance. I'll definitely come back to this when there's some\u00a0clarification on what I need to do!",
      "I really liked the idea behind the original submission. I was looking forward to playing a refined version but as the game is currently it is very confusing. I \u00e2\u0080\u009csolved\u00e2\u0080\u009d the first puzzle by trial and error but then didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do in the narrow passage. I know where the mine is but it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away unless I clikc on it and die. I bet there is a strategy that I am missing. Could you add some clarification in the game page?"

      "Really awesome! I love how you managed to bring snake into this game, a bit more unsure about the projectiles (I don't think they 100% fit) but you managed it very well! Collecting the pages was a fun objective, although it meant I got to learn the mechanics in a bit of an weird order, so I had to figure things out myself instead.Even so, I still felt motivated to play through the whole thing, and it never felt too hard or too easy.",

      "hi nice work you realy made the game betterunforchanatly i dint saw any animals andprojectiles in thegamebut like the game",
      "I still really like these puzzler game mechanics. No notes from me on this round, very well done!",
      "Really cool game. It's awesome the way that the flat block shoots and that the blocks can control the snake was unexpected but brilliant. It took me a while to get the snake in the right shape to climb it but I got there in the end and the secret entrance was really good too!",
      "My brain is not big enough for this game. I\u00a0still loved it. I'll make my brain bigger, then try and finish it.",
      "puzzle design is brilliant and there's no better feeling than mastering the controls in this and then moving around seamlessly especially when there's callbacks to patterns. really like how you navigated the task and transformed a winning title into something even better!",
      "Metroidvania gang!! This game was great, follows up Shift Shape magnificently.\u00a0 The projectiles and animals were incorporated so well, some of the continued games from round 1 felt like they had the themes shoved in but I think they make the game much better here. The snakes were cool as they force the player to sort of make their own puzzles and the projectiles added an interesting level of positioning. Some things I did felt really unintended but I think that just made it much more fun to do. My only complaint was that moving around felt kind of slow which led me to not want to backtrack much, the shortcut in snake tower is great but other than that going from one end of the map to another just takes a while. With some more mechanics and variety I could absolutely see a full metroidvania in this, amazing job.",
      "Nice work!\u00a0 Very relaxing experience",
      "Gosh! Another spectacular entry to the Shift Shape saga! The concepts for the animal and projectiles are soooo well conceived and the atmosphere perfectly matches the intended vibe. 10/10",
      "Woah! Great work! I love the unique storytelling and the gameplay mechanics. With some work, this game could become a classic puzzle platformer.",
      "Really fun and engaging game :) Good job.",
      "Amazing game like I said in Discord! I played it again as intended. I still can't find the 13th page though. My only complaint is that the projectile shooting is a little clunky to use, which works great for the puzzle-like feel of the game, but it felt slightly repetitive in the projectile tower when there were a lot of blocks to shoot."

      "Without question, the best platformer I've played so far! Loved the characters, they were just fun to listen to. My main issue was that there are a TON of areas where you just have to restart because you didn't do down a ramp fast enough. There were also a good amount of times I died because the speed you need to clear some areas removes all the reaction time I have. Beyond that, this is an amazing game. Fantastic work!",
      "Incredible fast paced action and you should be proud of yourself for making such a cool game. The art style and everything really came together nicely. I think my only real criticism is it can feel at times almost a little to chaotic, I think you just need to really hammer down on what the main mechanics are and stick with them. I thought it was brilliant though, I was thoroughly impressed with how much you've managed to achieve in the time since you started developing this idea. Great job and keep it up!",
      "Very fast and chaotic, reminds me the old Sonic games where you have no idea where you're going and you hit a bunch of walls and slow down and you have to die a lot to figure out when you have to tap the jump button or take another action. Not my favorite kind of game but it was fun. Good work!",

      "Great game with amazing art! I love how smooth the movement feels. The gameplay feels very fast-paced and fun. I like the story as well. I think I accidentally got soft-locked - there was no way to kill the living bird and respawning didn't change anything, so I had to restart the whole game. Other than that, amazing game. Good job!",
      "This game was a ton of fun when it was at it's best. The controls felt really good and I love the ducks and using them to rocket jump. I think the end of the story was very abrupt but I might have missed something in the last level as I rocket jumped accidently straight into the end from decently far away.\u00a0The animals, mostly the duck, were fun to use but didn't really seem 'animal.' The only animal who's ability lines up with what I would guess is the bird that allows you to glide. But for some reason hitting a dead bird teleports you to it and the lizard shoots bullets and the ducks explode, these could be anything besides animals and they'd make more sense. I also only used the lizard during the lizard tutorial where it forces you to, mostly because it has no mobility use besides shooting birds and that use isn't worth the fact that I don't know how to drop it and can't pick up other animals D:",
      "Very fun! Love the mechanics, the flow of movement and the cutscenes! The use of the animals is all really fleshed out and works crisply",
      "The movement feels great, you did amazing work in this round and this game fits very well with the task and more importantly you managed to continue on the same universe and made \"part two\" with a different character. Really awesome work! I have some nit-picks which don't affect my judgement (the game is at least top 10% in my opinion)"

      "19 seconds! Fun game!",
      "This game is good at telling a story without words. The art is good too.",
      "Great opening sequence - excellent way to setup the story without any dialogue. \u00a0I like twin stick shooters, but having to use the keyboard to aim and shoot was really hard - I wish I could have used my mouse. \u00a0I'm afraid I died a bunch and didn't get very far in this game, but I think just adding some other control options would help a lot. \u00a0I hope you keep working on it.",
      "That was fun. I actually managed a pacifist run after going through throwing birds at everything :)",
      "a bit of a bug found by mistake\u00a0then duplicated. get stuck between the robot and the first green barrel the robot stops attacking you so you dont die but prevents you from moving from that position. not criticizing just reporting it\u00a0to\u00a0you. all around great game though loved the whole thing the story the birds the birds are projectiles didn't finish though side scrolling games like that just arent really my cup of tea but still great game.",
      "Really nice way of presenting the narrative in the beginning! Awesome art too. I also liked the way the enemy projectiles kind of wobbled forward, much more interesting than a simple straight trajectory.I felt like the control scheme could be further simplified by not needing to press space, simple press left to shoot left, up to shoot up e.t.c. I got used to it quickly but can't find a reason to have picking direction and firing on different buttons.",
      "This really hit the theme perfectly to me.\u00a0 The story, animal, and projectiles all really flowed together and the game had an incredible amount of polish.\u00a0 Great job!!",
      "Really fun story and great animation. I love how much love went into the art, it's cool how the dialogue is\u00a0written in ideogram so you don't have to worry about localization haha. Great classic beat-em-up gameplay and the bird projectiles were a smart way of interpreting the theme.",
      "The animal projectiles was a great use of the main mechanic! It was tricky to fight the robots that shoot back though, so I ended up just running past everything. Loved the story as well, very simple and easy to follow!",
      "Very cute\u00a0game,\u00a0nice\u00a0story!",
      "Lovely art and charming game. It's creative to combine the animal and the projectile. The story is simple but clear. I think gameplay-wise there's no reason to fight robots right now. The reward time reduction dropped by robots can easily be saved if you just run to the end.",
      "Having the birds that are part of the story being\u00a0the projectiles in the game is a great idea that worked very well. Fun game!",
      "This was great! Very cute. My only complaint is that you can just avoid the enemies all together. I think a future update with \"boss rooms\" or \"clear the enemy rooms\" would be a wonderful addition. As it is, this is a great proof of concept!",
      "I thought you did a really good job of showing and not telling the story. Organic bad, Robot good. The visuals were so crisp! Nice little backing track as well. After getting my ass handed to me by our robot friends I decided to sprint my way through the level, and saved the princess in record time. Great job, this looked amazing."

      "I had fun moving around this strange world. I like the unique style and curious to see more of this !",
      "I love the art style with the 2D sprites in the 3D environment and how you presented the dialogue - it gives off comic book vibe.",
      "Very cool and unique look to this game.\u00a0\u00a0The story felt like an odd fever dream.\u00a0 Interesting and unusual game with extra points for originality.",
      "As others have mentioned, there's something just really satisfying about an absurd story that may or may not be a dream.\u00a0 Great job!",
      "Such an odd game. I love it. The dialogs were great and the story was interesting. Only thing I\u00a0had a minor problem with was that it was difficult to tell if the character was on the right line as the animals to hit them. Great game!",
      "I have... questions...",
      "That was kind of trippy :) Good job!",

I'm honestly not sure if I\u00a0won?\u00a0 I was told I'm dreaming, and then the camera panned up into the empty sky. I love the idea, but a little bit more structure, just to explain the chaos would be nice.",
      "That was a pretty cool experience. The story was cleverly done\u00a0I loved jumping into the cannon and shooting myself across the circus. The characters art work was really cool as well. They look straight out of an illustrated book for children or old school British comics like beano or the dandy, loved it.\u00a0Nice job!",

      "Let's just say I'm glad I didn't skip the tutorial! Even if the VA is AI, I must say that the writing is great! Well done! Gameplay wise I felt scammed every time I drew a card and paid, cause I thought it had loaded up a free one (some type of indication if it's free or not should be used, or even better that you draw them automatically like someone said below)",
      "This is definitely one of the coolest looking and sounding games (that voice over narration was awesome).\u00a0\u00a0I also loved all the story you packed in here.\u00a0 I really appreciate all the amazing work that went into that tutorial, but if I'm being honest, I found myself still a little lost at the end of it.\u00a0\u00a0I did my best to figure it out and play the game, but I was in over my head.\u00a0 I honestly think if I had someone to teach me this game, I would love it.\u00a0 It's easily one of the most professional of all the games and I have no doubt it will move on.\u00a0 \u00a0I'll look forward to playing it again.",

      "Really cool game! The visuals are unique and striking. I playtested this before the jam ended and didn't mind the tutorial too much but upon replaying it I wish that there was some way to skip even just individual voicelines. I think you did a phenomenal job incorporating projectiles and animals into your game. I think for the story you did a good job with what you had but I'm not a huge fan of just more of an implied backstory, I wish it was a bit more concrete.\u00a0Overall I really enjoyed the experience, great job expanding it from round 1!",
      "This is not the usual genre of game I am used to playing, but I think it's testament to your solid design skills that I was able to pick it up rather quickly. You did a good job of incorporating projectiles into a genre that doesn't usually facilitate such mechanics. I played through the tutorial first and thought the voice acting did a fantastic job of revealing the narrative, the rest of which is evident in the art and overall feel of the game. I didn't encounter any bugs and I don't really have any criticism other than the tutorial maybe going a little bit too long. Fantastic job!",

      "Let me start with the positive - the art and atmosphere are gorgeous.\u00a0The story was fairly engaging and kept me playing. That being said, the game didn't really come together for me.\u00a0This is probably a personal thing, but I felt kind of bored throughout the whole game. First of all, the gameplay was pretty repetitive and menial. I think that expanding the map wasn't a great choice as it just increased the tedium of finding the right rabbits, maybe having more variations or rabbits that look more similar to one another, to make it more risky to play.\u00a0I think having a menial task like this as the main game loop could serve as a great vessel for horror but my other issue was that the game wasn't scary, and I think there's a lot of reasons why.\u00a0Firstly there's no actual indication that you are in danger. The music is still calm and the vibes are still immaculate. There was at least one moment where there was a monster chasing me and I didn't notice. Having some adaptive music, maybe a tint on the screen or a vignette would have gone a long way. The other thing is that the monsters are complete nonthreats. I don't think I got hit once over both my playthroughs (during the jam and right now).\u00a0They are way slower than the player, and not only that but shooting knocks them back and stuns them. Something I did in my first round game was have the monster increase slowly in speed, creating moments on tension where they're close but then you pull ahead but then they start getting closer.\u00a0This forces you to get out of danger as quickly as possible too. Finally, there's never a moment where you are actually forced into danger. If you are just careful while playing, even if you don't know to avoid them, you might not encounter a single threat.",
      "I loved this. The story was nice too.",
      "I love\u00a0this. Good\u00a0story,\u00a0simple\u00a0mechanics\u00a0but\u00a0perfectly for\u00a0the\u00a0task.\u00a05/5\u00a0gj!",
      "Definitely top 10. Great work!!!",
      "Got to be up there with the best games of this jam. Great job with the atmosphere and overall story. Shooting mechanics felt crisp and you the way interpreted this rounds task was very clever (animal crucial to gameplay). Fantastic job!",
      "That was intense ;) Good job.",
      "Really good game. The artwork is amazing, I especially like the swaying trees and the rabbits when they get bigger. I found the engagement ring too and the twist\u00a0at the end is brilliant. Coming back to the new title screen is a nice touch. One idea that I think could improve your game would be to automatically go to the next day rather than clicking it",

      "I cannot think of a single thing I\u00a0don't like about this game. Without any spoilers, the ending gave me chills of realization. Very well done, I\u00a0hope you win!",

      "As the alternative ending correctly guessed, I was not happy about\u00a0shooting the poor rabbits, monsters or not, and shooting a wrong one was the worst in particular. But I could see the humor of it as well. The controls and graphics & general feel of the game was perfect, playing to the end was not a chore,\u00a0well done.",

      "As others have said, this game seems way to hard. Not that making a difficult game is bad, but when most of my deaths were caused by the cat just killing itself constantly, it begins to build frustration. The puzzles were fun! It's just that every section the lacked a wall just sucked to play. Even with my complaints, I would love to see a more polished version of this game! It has a great concept, lovely art, and wonderful audio. The only thing holding this game back for me is the seemingly unfair difficulty.",

      "As you all mentioned, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. Aside from the bug fixes and the model changes in d-bug, there haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been any other significant changes. I had intended to focus solely on developing this game during the GDKO, but upon seeing that the tasks in Round 2 already existed in my game, I realized that I had committed too much too early, given my small capabilities during Round 1. So this time, I decided to put off the ideas I had in mind. However, in hindsight, I realize it would have been better to at least update the UI or focus on other quality improvements. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m grateful for the interest in my game, and I apologize for any disappointments.",
      "I agree with the previous comment, this game was honestly one of my favorites during the first round and I was really happy that you got to the next round,\u00a0but I also wished for more content for the second round. Not necessarily more genres, but at least more levels and such.",
      "This was cool! I'm a little confused because I\u00a0think this was the exact same game you uploaded to round 1?\u00a0Not complaining, I guess I'm just bummed out that there wasn't a few more new genres."

The polish was pretty impressive considering the time it was put together in. The story felt a little bit disconnected with the gameplay but the projectiles and animals were worked together very cohesively.

I appreciate the lively\u00a0performance of the voice actor\u00a0and sound design tho!",
      "I\u00a0think this is a cool concept. My one request is that if you're going to have a game like this, you need to at least prepare the player for what they're getting into. For example, a screen with audio settings would have been great. I\u00a0also think that, for a game based off of sound design, normalize the audio levels.

The story was incredibly simple but added charm to the gameplay that wouldn't have been present without it, so nice job there. Overall, great job and incredibly polished game!",
      "New favorite Game Jam game just dropped. This is genuinely in the top 5 of ALL Game Jam games I've ever played. The story was super fun! I wish more viruses were just cats lol. All the gameplay was really captivating, managing to ensure I never looked away from my screen for a second! I would love to see an expanded version of this game, similar to \"There Is No Game.\" I would buy it in an instant!",
      "That was awesome. One of the best I've played so far, perfect entry.",
      "One of my favorites for the round. Simple, but fun and the story really ties in well. Great looking UI as well, I made sure to the computer fully. Great job.",
      "I really like the narrative with the cat .",
      "Great game and cute story!",
      "This game has such a great vibe. I'm torn because the story and gameplay are great, but the theme just feels off to me. I think there are other ways to tell this story that don't require the computer interface. At the same time, the meta kitty cat memeing on me is great! Maybe instead of a cat computer program, it could be a goblin dungeon I'm trying to escape?\u00a0I dunno. All that is just nitpicking anyway, you've made a great game. Thanks for making me smile!"

      "Super fun game!",
      "Killer opening scene, maybe my favorite.\u00a0 Love the look of it all and especially the sound effects.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm not very good at these kind of games, but I still enjoyed this one.\u00a0\u00a0The surfing was cool and the death sound was perfect (I heard it a lot). :)",
      "This was fantastic!\u00a0 Just the sort of absurd story and unique gameplay I love to see from game jams and that you do so great at!!\u00a0 Incredible game!",
      "The story was absurd and I love it :D",
      "Amazing storytelling. I loved the opening cutscene SO MUCH.\u00a0I feel so bad for poor old granny.",
      "It was a very strange story ) Interesting surfing idea!\u00a0 I find the area just after the first book the most difficult in the game; maybe it's just for me. And despite of full description of how to beat the boss, it took me >20 tries )",
      "I love that surfing mechanics :)",
      "Fun game! I wish that the jump was a bit floatier up and then faster down instead of the other way around.\u00a0The boss was a bit tricky but only really in what you had to do to hit him, not really to avoid him, which in my opinion made the fight less fun than had it been avoiding his attacks to get an attack off. The cutscene at the start was super cute and the end I think did a good job of bringing it together even if the middle part felt a little bit weird with the story.\u00a0I think that the projectiles were neat, I liked the multi use of the slime stuff to shoot and to surf and I think that the animals were a good inclusion too. The whole game really felt like a solid and complete experience. It was maybe a bit too difficult for me but that's probably a me issue. I had a great time, well done!",
      "Very fun game. As far as the story task with projectile and animal requirements I\u00a0think you nailed it. I loved that you had controller support! Well done!",
      "I love this! I found the final boss a little tricky since you had to jump so close to the wall to hit him, but after a few tries I\u00a0got it. I'm also not sure if I missed this in the tutorial, but I didn't know you could slime bats until I\u00a0did it on accident. Otherwise, 10/10 game!",
      "Visuals and sound were really cool. Cutscene at the start was well made, setting out the story for the game. \u00a0Star of the show was the level design, it felt very well put together. Awesome job, I really enjoyed it.",
      "Damn this was an awesome experience. I'm happy I\u00a0got to play this! Well done! :D",
      "Was great\u00a0to\u00a0play\u00a0on\u00a0stream! Please feel\u00a0free\u00a0to\u00a0watch for comments\u00a0there (around 01:36:15)",
      "Fun and silly game you made here. I always enjoy playing through yours. Well done.",
      "Amazing game - I love the art style and the cutscene!"

      "The platforming feels great! I felt I could move precisely and if I ever got hit, I deserved it. I\u00a0love the minimal color pallet, too, reminds me of old GameBoy games\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e",
      "always nice to see a game with the\u00a0 coyote jump :)",
      "Cool platformer.\u00a0\u00a0It was very satisfying to beat the big boss chicken.\u00a0 Love the pixel art style and monochromatic design. Also, the retro music was perfect.\u00a0 Also, not too hard, which I really appreciate.\u00a0\u00a0Really well done!",
      "A really simple and fun platformer! The story was filled to the brim with character, and the art was really nice. The combat didn't really seem necessary, and I had an issue with the gun not reloading if you turned around before the animation was done. Not a huge issue, but it causes me some confusion. The end scene reminded of Cuphead, so that was fun! Great work.",
      "Well done! A fun and well done game!",
      "Fun game, satisfied all criteria, and great work on the particle effects. You are just 13, you have great future ahead :)",
      "This was a good submission! I\u00a0can tell that you worked hard on the enemy pathfinding and stuff. All around, pretty good for such a short game!",
      "Pretty silly but ultimately fun\u00a0story\u00a0:D\u00a0the\u00a0chickens weren't much of\u00a0a\u00a0threat, except for that congaline\u00a0that\u00a0showed up when you\u00a0jumped down a cliff\u00a0in\u00a0one of the later\u00a0levels\u00a0:') and\u00a0I\u00a0liked that there\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0boss\u00a0at the end.",
      "The art was cute and the story was simple but enough to make the game feel complete. I think that the animals made the simple platformer a lot more engaging but I didn't feel myself shooting really at all, considering the enemies were predictable and not actively aggressive\u00a0whilst also being tanky enough that they are annoying to kill. I think the game could have used a bit more variety, maybe with the platformer controller from r1 to add some more movement options for example, but there were not enough levels that it really felt like it dragged on.\u00a0Cheesed the boss by standing in the corner and shooting but it was still a nice addition and way to end the game. I had some issues shooting while changing direction, which is actually another reason why I didn't fight enemies as you can't run away and then quickly turn around to shoot. I did think that the animations were very cute though and I think that the game did come together as a complete product, nice job!",
      "Good Job.",
      "Nice aesthetic and color palette. I\u00a0appreciate the details in the animation, especially the smoke coming out of the gun when its on cooldown.",
      "I love the game boy colour palette. Great character design and the death animations for the chickens were cool. The story was pretty funny also and I enjoyed playing this game. Well done!",
      "Was great\u00a0to\u00a0play\u00a0on\u00a0stream and have you there popping in!",
      "Fun game with graphics and a palette I love. Good story, well done.",
      "Music is good, the story is funny and meggech was cool! It fits the criteria nicely good job",
      "Your character design and name is fantastic and I love the art style. I liked the boss fight too and it was great watching it\u00a0bouncing around trying to squash me.\u00a0As others have said,\u00a0I also wasn't able to read the text fast enough",
      "nice music! I liked how everything was straight to the point. No frills.The text is a little difficult to read, though.",
      "Very charming color and style! So OG gameboy-esqueI love the story too haha! Simple and sweet",
      "",
      "good game looks cool unforchunatly no story,",

      "This was an interesting platformer with a fun backstory.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately,\u00a0I was terrible at this game.\u00a0 Everything moved so fast and I died on the spikes so many times.\u00a0 I wish there were difficulty levels.\u00a0 I'm sure others were brilliant at it though and I just need to practice more.\u00a0 Good job.",
      "I really enjoyed this game in the fisrt round. Nice to see how it's grown since then. Good job :)",
      "movement was very fluent loved the use of the projectiles. kinda for some reason took me back to good old crash bandicoot. the original one thank god it wasn't as hard though. wish there was a bit more of a story i saw that you used more context then directly telling what is happening which is always a neat way to tell a story and as the development process well... develops...the story will unravel\u00a0 but this has some real potential",
      "The platforming controls themselves have a had a major improvement from Round 1! That being said, I deeply miss the old system of collecting animals an items. They allowed for so much creativity and cool problem solving options! The new system of shooting things to make them bigger is just, in my humble opinion, a much less interesting concept. Regardless, still a good platformer!",
      "Platforming was super responsive\u00a0and the level design was super clean.\u00a0I liked how you had to shoot the animals and mushrooms\u00a0to embiggen them. The backtracking portion was made really clear with the camera panning and clever foreshadowing. The last platforming bit was super challenging and precise but I got it eventually.",
      "I see you removed the ability to pick up animals, to now just make them bigger.",
      "I find\u00a0it a bit\u00a0hard\u00a0to hit\u00a0stuff\u00a0as\u00a0bullets\u00a0feel a bit small, but\u00a0liked\u00a0it\u00a0anyway\u00a0:)\u00a0good\u00a0job",
      "loved it!i dont really have a\u00a0 lot to say but you made this game very wellgreat work!!",
      "Everything came together quite nicely! I found the hitboxes for the spikes to be wayyy to large compared to their sprites, which was a bit annoying when riding a snail across but horrible when traversing up the part with the angled spikes. The animals and projectiles work really well together but I don't really know what the story was. The art and music was simple but consistent and an enjoyable enough vessel for the gameplay. Overall, nice job!",
      "Pretty sweet. I like how you switched things up from the round 1 entry because I remember really enjoying that one too! Keep going!",
      "Very cool game!",
      "The platforming and shooting were fun and a bit challenging. I\u00a0think you got everything in there as far as the challenge of the round and it's a fun game.",
      "This is cool! Very chill guy energy."
