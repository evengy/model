      "Very neat visuals with all the effects and stuff. I kinda didn't know what was happening though, I tried following the flying plant thing, but\u00a0the floaty movement made it challenging and I have no idea what the purple portal on the ceiling does. I also tried going up and down from the beginning, but none of the paths seemed to lead me anywhere. But I must say that the audio design is great and overall vibe is\u00a0really intriguing and well made!",
      "Really excellent look and feel and environment. I missed that you could go up and down from the big entry room, so I got to the end with only the plant and that was a little confounding. A simple fix might be to add a clear \"up\" and \"down\" arrow to the signs or some environmental path guiding with little glowy thing to pick up along the way. But overall a solid entry!",
      "This was a fun little game!! Loved how you had to build the little robot and then got to fly it at the end!!",
      "A fun game. I'll have to try the download when I'm done with all the other games. I think the camera could help a little by tracking ahead of the movement. It took me some time to get used to the movement, but the game itself was fun enough to keep me engaged without getting frustrated or bored.",
      "Indeed a fun way to start out, even though a simpler image would have worked, somehow have the feed of the human hands just worked so charmingly well. I will admit I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to the end full end (or at least, not with all the features unlocked), after the starting tutorial area it seemed to be less of a storytelling arena and more just obstacle course. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit to some confusion as which ways were valid paths, there definitely was some good nudges with the signs but I found myself bouncing against walls where I thought the game was nudging me to go.",
      "This was really cool!\u00a0 I liked the assembly line to start out.\u00a0 A few of the areas felt a little more difficult than needed for a game this short, but it wasn't to the point that the game wasn't fun.\u00a0 Great job!"

      "I'm a big fan of your art and all your design, very polished. Maybe better to first focus on gameplay and then focus on art. I think your art probably already looks great when you do 20% of the work.",
      "Game is short but art is really amazing ! Excellent work on the integration in the itch page.",
      "Stellar work! Really sold the style well, and as always your itch.io presentation is on point. Pretty awesome what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to accomplish with straight html/css/javascript so kudos there.",
      "When is the next comic coming out? Okay the art is by far the best I've ever seen, holy crap you are amazing! You can easly follow the story, such a good idea!I need the next chapter!!",
      "Amazing art, it just jumps at you! Do you do this professionally lol? I wished i could turn the pages back to read it again hehe.",
      "super cool idea, wish it were longer! (also i keep being impressed by the game pages alone, great work)",
      "Great game, I'd love to see more.\u00a0 The art and playing inside the comic was awesome.\u00a0 Very well done.",
      "The artstyle is awesome, I love the comic pages and their animations, they're so cool! Really unfortunate that there was no time for more levels, but I\u00a0get it, real life always gets in the way. The story was pretty clear, but as I said, the highlight for me is the way the story is presented. Really great entry!",
      "",
      "Damn HugBug you set a real high standard, was a beautiful game and I loved your comic experience (as a big comic fan myself). Game part was nice and very effective though I was looking forward to the next pages (of game), great job!",
      "I love the aesthetic and the art is really good. The attention to detail is immaculate, and I love how you described your art process. I'd love to see a post-jam version with more levels (or an update\u00a0later in the tournament). Very well done!",
      "As always, incredible job.\u00a0 I like that you described your art process in the description as well!\u00a0 The little details really came through on this one as well, with things lighting up when you hit the lightning button, the sound effects and shake when the gate opened, etc... Your games are always so good it's hard to find things to give constructive criticism on but you always give good feedback so I'll see if I can pass on some advice about platformers I've been given.\u00a0 The jump animation while moving was really great, but there wasn't a jump animation for jumping while standing still, which made the jump feel pretty stiff.\u00a0 Endmark gave me the advice last year of using a little vertical stretch on jumping and horizontal stretch on landing, and I've found it gives a really natural jump look even without a unique jump animation.\u00a0 In some ways I think the limited animation kind of fit the comic book aesthetic, though, so I wouldn't complain if it's an intentional choice.\u00a0 Big fan of your work!\u00a0 The comic book aesthetic is fantastic!",
      "Your game is incredibly well-presented and the comic book art style looks very professional. I really liked moving across the level and using the lightning bolts, also really great\u00a0seeing the comic book come to life"

      "All five stars for me!\u00a0Very excellently done.",
      "Solid entry, and love seeing how this saga continues! Also you did a great job retelling the story of the prior rounds without it being over kill, the sequence of several very short scenes told the story very well. I also think having the choices of what to do during the game helps reinforce the idea of the storytelling being central. I got at least two endings, and thanks to your tip on how to beat the boss, I figured out the detail of standing underneath to get the spider to do my dirty work.",
      "What a great game! love the art style, and that you had the option to choose which path to take. That is such a good idea! I will say the beginning story part was a little fast but other than that it was a great game!!",
      "You've always done great with Crunkle but this one especially I really loved.\u00a0 Having the player choice impact the story was a really smart move, and it was REALLY satisfying to get different endings based on what I chose instead of just a pseudo choice.\u00a0 Based on the other comments I think there's a general consensus that the intro cutscene moved a little fast and I'd agree with that.\u00a0 I felt like I was struggling to follow.\u00a0 Some of your cutscenes had a button input to progress them and I think it would have been good to see it there as well so the player could progress once they felt they understood the current scene.\u00a0 No critiques besides that, though.\u00a0 Great game and great entry!",
      "I MADE A NOTE SO I WONT FORGET: \"comment on the logo having no letters to comply with the round's theme\"",
      "The story is very engaging, I like how it is told between levels and how I can make choices to influence it.",
      "Yay, another installment of the Crunkle series! I love the stealth elements of this one and enjoyed being able to pick my path. Only advice would be slower cutscenes, but that's a small nitpick.\u00a0Very well done!",
      "Fantastic continuation of the Crunkle series. Excellent story seamlessly fitting all three games. Great art and gameplay as always. I had to play through twice to make sure I got all of the different options. One of my favorites this round.",
      "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic to see the continuation of your game and the extra levels are really awesome. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really clever using the beast to defeat Crunkle and I like the other bad guys too. The cutscenes throughout the game\u00a0capture the story perfectly and prove that a picture really is worth a thousand words",
      "I like how I can pick the route I want to go, and how every level had multiple routes to colplete. At first I went to the police, but I didnt like\u00a0that ending, so I\u00a0tried to fight crunkle, but I\u00a0couldnt damage him.Still a pretty good entry, I like the short cutscenes that tell the story, and how its tied to the leves and gameplay. Good Job!"

(also are the things on the menu from septembit? cause i feel like I've seen them before lol)",

After seeing one of your tweets, I realized there was more than what I initially encountered. I went back and was able to unveil the glitchy red book, but still I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m definitely not getting all of what you showed off.",

      "Always love your art style and game entries. I couldn't get the second of four endings it looks like. I'll try again when I'm done playing and rating the rest.",
      "All the art and animations are awesome. The gameplay is confusing, but fun to play around with. I didn't quite get the story, but I still enjoyed picking up and moving cats. Also, I love the pun in the title!",
      "I played through the whole game twice and still don't really know what was happening? The art and animations are superb and adorable. A bit more instruction or direction for the gameplay would have been nice. Overall well done.",
      "The animations, particularly the way the books open and shut are awesome. I also liked the ability to pick up the cats and basically clicking on everything to see what it did was fun. Best of luck in both jams"

      "I really like this approach to a point and click. It gives a nice \"documentary\" feeling to it, and lets us wonder about who took these pictures. Nice work!",
      "Very clever take on a horror film! And paired with good, intuitive controls, I was able to get make my way to the monster and subsequently die. No nits from me!",
      "Such a good game, using polaroids to tell the story is a great idea and on top its a horror theme! I was expecting every time something was going to reach out and grab me lol.",

      "Wow, a really polished and unique horror game! I got stuck at some\u00a0points, but I made it to the ending.\u00a0I like how the story is told through environment. The visuals and audio create a very creepy mood. Great game!",

      "The polaroid photo style is absolute genius.\u00a0 I'd for sure play a longer game in this style!\u00a0 My only feedback is that a little instruction at the beginning to know to check the edges for being able to turn in a room would help, and maybe some different types of keys?\u00a0 Nothing was to a point that I didn't figure it out pretty quick, though, and this was a five stars across the board entry for me.",
      "the framing for the game is amazing! love how the polaroids limit your movement and vision which makes things more tense, this could definitely be turned into a full game :D",
      "Using photos to tell the story and navigate the house is a great idea. Finding the key to open the door felt like a classic and satisfying click-adventure game and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented really well throughout. However, after reaching the car, I felt a bit lost so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to play again another day to see if I missed something"

Sort of felt like a classic \u00e2\u0080\u009cdistract you thinking one thing, when it becomes another\u00e2\u0080\u009d.",
      "Fun game with a good story. A tiny bit of juice would have made a lot of difference, but it is a good game regardless.",
      "A fun little game! The graphics are nice. I think a little more could have been done with the levels as they didn't really ever feel challenging, just like a chore, even though they were building up to the end part. I think the story was good, but could have been alluded to a bit earlier so you understand what's happening better.\u00a0As others have suggested, just having a little end card or something would be so much better than just restarting, but overall, nice job.",
      "I tried to find an alternative ending/play method but couldn't find it (if there is one), the SFX and graphics were a highlight. As GameFavourites suggested and ending would have added some to the game.",
      "Breaking the blocks and flipping the switches is great and the sound effects add a nice touch to the experience. I think the game might benefit from having an end screen as it could be more rewarding than starting at the beginning but all in all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty good"

      "Love the simplicity of the idea and the variety in gameplay! Great story very well executed \u00e2\u00ad\u0090",
      "Very strong entry. The gameplay was engaging and completely new to me, which I love. Strong contender for top three game of this round, imo. The approach of telling a full story through gameplay worked very well.",
      "Was really cool reminded me of old Sega games took me a while to get the feel of the mechanic but once I did it was a lot of fun. Loved the boss battle and intro scene!",
      "Fun title! I liked how it conveyed a clear story while being short a sweet - with some puzzle/platformers, the story can get lost with too many levels, but the setup was clear enough and not too long to lose focus. Loved the detail at the end of the credits where the scientists turns back to human (but then reverts themselves back to being a monster? I guess the power was just too great).",
      "Such a satisfying game to play! Really love the music, makes you just want to play more and more! Love the art and the story!",
      "Such a sick game! I loved the story, loved the mechanics! It felt sooooo good to slam dunk the crystal straight in the portal with the \"pushing away\" psychics!\u00a0Amazing work on this one GameFavorites!",
      "Very fun\u00a0puzzle game, I love the levels, even though some of them are pretty hard. The narrative is clear to me and the ending is really satisfying. Great job!",
      "Great game. I loved the art and the sounds, but I the level puzzles with the telekinesis mechanic\u00a0were my favorite part of this game.",
      "Really fun concept. I liked the gameplay a lot, although I found the level 3 really diffcult with the precise move at the end. I did like how every level the mechanic changed, good job",
      "Super fun, a couple more levels would have been nice and I hit the boss a couple times before it actually was destroyed, which felt a little unintuitive (I imagine it has a specific hitbox).\u00a0The mechanic was fairly original and fun to use, well done.",
      "I love the art, cutscene, and mechanics on this one!\u00a0 Really solid entry!",
      "Cool mechanics :) was very intuitive and satisfying :)"

      "Really love how everything fit together, and the really crisp (vector delivered?) graphics. Almost seems crazy for me to say this, but in a way I wish it was a bit shorter as it was a little long to go through the whole thing multiple times to see the different endings - but I really appreciate therebeingdifferent entries, so nice work on that front.",
      "Love the graphics that both match the cultural settings and suggest old school pixel graphics. A very complete game for such a short jam, with a nice story mechanic that builds well.",
      "Great art, music, and level design. Love the mini boss fights!!! And such a good ending on you having to choose who gets to live based on their stories you find out about!",
      "This was great!\u00a0 I feel like the environment was top tier, and the way things would time up with the music was a great touch.\u00a0 Overall phenomenal entry.\u00a0 My only complaint is that there was a spot in the green area that felt a little too confusing with getting past the arrows.\u00a0 Looks like Spoonsweet got stuck in the same spot.\u00a0 I feel like sometimes the mechanics slowed the story down a little bit but that might have been my preference for the difficulty.\u00a0 Great game!",
      "Such a cool game! The story on the painting was a great way to give context and narrative!Also, the environmental story telling with all the souls moving to the door.. wow",
      "Another great game. I loved the battles and the story was great. High marks for all the criteria.",
      "First of all, the amount of polish packed in is incredible. I love the art and the color choices. A couple more music tracks would have been nice (for different areas), as the one got repetitive and the boss music felt a little out of place.\u00a0 Multiple boss fights is great, but they felt a little easy. (I remember playing an earlier version when they were extremely hard, so a middle ground would have been nice.) I love the variety in obstacles and areas, and the level design was super great. Collecting the different pictures and following the story was very fun too, well done.",
      "really nice game! the art was nice and the story was really enjoyable :D",
      "The game is really good! The boss fights were definitely a highlight for me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 challenging but rewarding. I think the overall pace could be improved with slightly faster movement or perhaps slightly slower boss attacks. The main game had a great variety, and although some parts were tough, I persevered. I reached what seems like the final boss with a parrot keeping an eye on things no less. I think I almost had it, but I'll have to try again another day"

      "Super perfect color palette, lovely simple animations, easy to understand gameplay. Just the right length for a jam game. And the ending is adorable.",
      "Nice entry, well polished. Though it was in a way fairly light on the story, it did have a beginning, middle, and rewarding feeling end so that hits the mark! Everything fit together quite nicely - even your itch page, nice to see what you learned.",
      "Really fun little game. I love the blue visuals, everything feels cohesive and very polished. I appreciate the collisions tutorial, which is a nice way to get the player to understand the game. The ending was adorable, but I didn't feel like there was much of a story there outside of it. The difficulty is not too high, I managed to get all fish in my second try, it was a good idea to only slow the player down a little when they hit something instead of instantly restarting the whole run. Overall, really solid entry. Feels like a finished game, well done!",
      "I had a lot of playing this one. The game was easy to get into and the chase was fun. And the story worked well with the game.",
      "Such a cool vibe in this game!The colours, the music, the kisses!",
      "Wow really please to see your little otter again great build the last round and the story that ending made it :) there is going to be some fat baby otters soon!",
      "Adorable artwork with a minimalistic color palette. Fun gameplay and the ending ties the whole story together seamlessly. Great job.",
      "Super fun game! I love how it is fairly forgiving, but not too much so, and it has just the right level of difficulty (with optional ways to challenge yourself). The art looks so much better than last round honestly, the color palette is super nice. Overall, very well done.",
      "The story was simple but clear, and flowed super well into the gameplay.\u00a0 Really good job with this!",
      "The wordless tutorial blended seamlessly with the gameplay. Reaching the end with all 9 fish and getting through that narrow gap was really cool. I liked the environmental obstacles like the nets, rocks and seagrass and thought the game was really fun. The progress at the bottom was a nice addition too"

      "Kudos for getting something submitted!\u00a0Haha this is what I feel like when I wake up in the morning.",
      "I really liked the style and was excited to hit the road but couldn't get my car to go. Very cohesive and a good use of sounds will def check back and try again.",
      "As always love how the environment is paper and just looks amazing! I can see how the breathing would help due to traffic and bad drivers. I live in a city with just horrible drivers and find myself having to take deep breaths to calm down!",
      "First off, really love how you used the art and the theme of cars through the rounds this year!Loved the idea with the alarm showing the time (would have liked some feedback on the \"button mash space\" at that part, since I had no indication if my massing was doing anything. I applaud the idea of the quick space to get donut, as it does mimic irl situations.",
      "As with the rest of your games this year, the art style is great. I liked the one button mechanics and would love to have seen more, I get the time running out. Good game.",
      "The one button breathing mechanic\u00a0is pretty fun and\u00a0I love the first-person animations. It's unfortunate that there is not much more to the game, but I can see the potential. The artstyle really fits the game with all the scribbled lines and the audio is very good too.",
      "I wish it was a longer story, but what you have is super well told!",
      "Sure, there isn't much, but what's there is super polished. The animations are incredibly smooth, and seeing the hand drawn style in first person this time was incredible gratifying. I'd love to see an updated post-jam version.",
      "I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve captured the anxious atmosphere really well and having the first person perspective works really well for this. I also love the 3D hand drawn look to your game and the diverse way of using one button"

      "Strong entry, in my opinion. A very complete game with some nice narrative elements. If I had a suggestion for future work, it might be to consider fewer controls and features, as the base gameplay with just movement and TK is super cool, and that idea could be expanded more, making the game easier to learn. Nice work, truly!",
      "It was a cool game really cool style with the dynamic hair it reminded me of Flashback a lot which when compared to is always a good thing.",
      "Nice entry, you definitely managed to expand on your entry to add in a few more story beats. It worked well going into little flashback scenes (although, it did mean much of the storytelling was separate from the gameplay itself). I got to the ending, a sweet touch adding the ball back in there.",
      "very cool game you have here! I love the story with the ball and then the test subject. Your animations are SICK! I love the hear, the naruto run, the story within the story! I also agree, the game fusion might have been a bit too much, but greatly implemented and it works! So good job! I got stuck on the first Godot platform, didn't know where I could go from there. I am being peculiar and would have liked if you kept it text-less for this round, but that doesn't take away from your great work!. Again, nice art, nice physics!",
      "This is a really fun game and I liked the story in the game.",
      "I really like this game that you've had going.\u00a0 One thing I'd say is that for a jam this short, I'd almost say have less in the game and really lock down a couple things.\u00a0 The weapon crafting mechanic for instance I thought was super cool, but I felt like it was a little out of place since there wasn't a lot of time to integrate it into the larger story.\u00a0 I'd love to see this turned into a more complete game, though!",
      "First of all, the graphics are stunning. The cutscenes were a little confusing and hard to follow, maybe because of the abstract art style. The fusion mechanic from round 1 still felt a little out of place and with that modifier removed it could maybe be simplified. Overall, great job.",
      "Really awesome that you continued on from the previous game. The telekinesis is super satisfying to use and interacts with the environment in interesting ways. The gameplay feels well-polished and is really excellent all round"

I also appreciate that you recognized those of us who maybe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the patience to get through all puzzles (definitely not me tho, ofc) by having the skip to next option, really helped to ensure I experienced the full extent of the story. Too bad about the bug, but having the gif there was a reasonable solution.",
      "Love the puzzels! Took me a second to understand what to do but when I understood, it was a fun game and good story as well!",
      "really nice story, great job :)",
      "Amazing work with this!The art, the colours, the cutscenes, the SFX and music! But most importantly the puzzle aspects and your choice to allow people to skip or retry. Genius way to not create any walls for players to be frustrated, rather, allowing us to move at our own pace and experience the story, or try to do better in another puzzle. Amazing work with the mechanics in the puzzles btw, felt so smart when I managed to git all the water in some (few) levels.PS: this game made me thirsty now.",

I think the game cleverly blends strategy with narrative and I really liked the later levels with the added obstacles"

      "Neat entry! It all lined up well. It was definitely good you had the mechanical mini game show up after the second round as I otherwise might have missed it. In fact, there were several points where I thought that was \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing to be it\u00e2\u0080\u009d but then there was a little more.

I really like the 3D artwork, the knight looks cool and it's great that you have to give him a sword.

The music also fits very well here and makes the situation more dramatic. It's unfortunate that there is nothing more, because the intro made me\u00a0feel like I am ready to fight the monster.",

      "Really cool how you tied everything together for the story. (I'm a bit jealous of you creating one continuous game, I think I will do the same thing next year)",
      "Nice work tying in prior rounds into a story, fun intro. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize I was traveling around in a bush at the start, I thought I was disguised as a boulder, a bush makes much more sense haha",
      "Yay!\u00a0It's cool to start to flesh out the back story, and huge kudos for getting a complete game done even though your Discord posts made it sound like you had to do a mad push at the end. I really enjoyed the stealth gameplay. Simple but a little challenging at first. As always the old timey atmosphere adds a lot to the story. One nit for me was that moving could also work with arrow keys, (Not that WASD is hard or anything, but for whatever reason I tried the arrow keys first.)",
      "Happy to have the origin story of Sir Spectacles !",
      "Nice to see your story continue though I guess it was more of a prequal, I really liked the hiding in the bush and it was fun to end with your round one entry battle.",
      "Will Sir Spectacle make it to the next level??? Tune into next weeks episode!! lol Love the game and the story was easy to follow!",
      "Back into the spectaverse! The music never gets old!",
      "Wow the prequel we've all been waiting for! Well done, this is a fun story to play through.",
      "More of sir spectacles is always fun! The gameplay was fun and the art style was very well executed. Great job!",
      "It's a neat idea to do a prequel to Sir Spectacles' story in this round, I enjoyed it!\u00a0The gameplay is fun, I really love the bush sneaking mechanic. The retro style is as always on point. Very well done, especially considering your situation!",
      "",
      "awesome to see sir spectacles continued for each round, great job!",
      "love getting to know mr spectacles backstory and what led up to what happens in your round one submission :D great game :)",
      "I like how you integrated the boss fight from Round 1 into the story. Overally a clear story with undelining gameplay. Even though you only had a couple of days, its still good :)",
      "Loving the prequel you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to see you continuing to build out this charming world. The environment and moving with the bush to stay hidden looked great and fitted the theme of Sir Spectacles character really well"

      "Super cool entry. One of my favorites so far. The lighting and sound effects and scene decoration really adds a sense of dread and discomfort, which I think is what you were going for.",
      "Pretty short, but very unique entry!\u00a0The way the environment conveys the story as player walks through each room is amazing and really sets up the mood. I was sure I was playing a horror game and waited for the\u00a0moment to hide in one of the spots. Very neat idea for a story with a plot twist!",
      "Wow really good visual story telling loved it real aliens vibes.",
      "Nice entry, I love how it really pulls the carpet under us. I was hiding in all the little containers and spaces you establish, when I should have been hiding from myself! The details of blood trails really helped throw me off and fret over what was going to be on the other side of each door.",
      "That plot twist... wow! What a great game! I was on edge waiting to enter a room and have to use the hiding options, turns out I never needed them haha. Great game and story!!",
      "Loten's back with another take all my stars entry haha.\u00a0 Dude both this year and last I feel like you do horror so well.\u00a0 Based on your space deck builder last year I went in expecting something Cobalt Core but the realization that it was a space horror story was very satisfying.\u00a0 Having things to hide in built the tension really well.\u00a0 Great job!\u00a0 You told a very compelling story with minimal cutscene, mostly just through environment and gameplay.\u00a0 Really killed it for this round.\u00a0 Only complaint is I wish there was more of it!",
      "A great engaging story! Loved the twist at the end.",
      "I see at the comments I was not the only one fooled with your story!",
      "The plot twist at the end is really good. Really ties the story together. The enviroment was a bit empty, but the hiding spots sold the story good. Overall a great entry",
      "The atmosphere was very well done and it definitely adds to the suspense. The hiding spots really made me thinkIwas running from something, before I started seeing people and wondering what the real threat was. I love the detail and the sound design was very good too. Overall, great job.",
      "The atmosphere on the spacecraft is incredible and really suspenseful. The hiding spots and seeing how the other people reacted was amazing and then that twist at the end, really well done. Also, the art is fantastic and I like all of the details like the blood trails and the way the light revealed what was in the room. Excellent all round"

      "You put a lot of effort in the visuals, it definitely paid off, everything looks great \u00e2\u00ad\u0090",
      "Simple, but very fun entry. To be honest, it took me like 10 times playing before I realized the intro \u00e2\u0080\u009ctutorial\u00e2\u0080\u009d sequence it was annoyingly making me replay each time wasactuallya selection screen. Once I got that, I was able to strategize much easier to get the \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect loadout\u00e2\u0080\u009d. That got me to 60pts so, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take 3rd on the leaderboard for now hehe but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty deterred from playing more since I have to spend a couple minutes just trying to get my ideal loadout (ie the cheaty sort of setup of [spoiler?] only selecting animals which are non solid so that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to really look at the shape or listen to the sound)",
      "Very nice concept that fits the challenge. Lovely graphics and lots of polish. It would be nice for the hunt picture to stay on screen a bit longer, at least at first, and maybe consider a \"learning\" level that has fewer kinds of animals. But overall nice work!",
      "Really fun game! Took me a second to realize I had to avoid the stories that I didn't experience to not get hurt!",
      "pesky crocodiles and cheatas always jumping on my spear!",
      "Very original idea for the gameplay and it really fits the task, because I feel like I am actually a caveman creating a story and documenting it with pictures in my cave. At first I thought I will have a hard time understanding the gameplay, but thanks to all the visual feedback and game juice I got it very quickly and started having fun.\u00a0The graphics\u00a0are beautiful, with the fire and stone wall\u00a0looking great.\u00a0One of the best entries this round,\u00a0in my opinion.",
      "super cool idea, like the cave art aesthetic!i suck at it tho,\u00a0having trouble telling the animals\u00a0apart",
      "Loved the look of the game and the theme. I like how the first bit is setting up the story and the second part is making sure you follow the story. Great game.",
      "I feel like you did a lot with a simple story here.\u00a0 The environment and cave drawings looked great, and the game was really self explanatory.\u00a0 Great job with this!",
      "This\u00a0game is a lot of fun. Swiping at the flying animals is really satisfying, and I love that I can pick the challenge at the start. The background and sounds are\u00a0also great - everything feels really polished",
      "Super fun and polished, I love how juicy it is.\u00a0The game has a really great mood, with the fire and the music.\u00a0Enjoyed this a lot.\u00a0Iwillcome back to this and conquer the leaderboard.\u00a0This I swear.",
      "Fun game, I really enjoyed playing and went for the high score. The cave, paintings and fire really set the mood for this game.\u00a0 Great job."

      "Love the idea, the game is really nice to play. Congrats !",
      "There was definitely a story of heart and key! Though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what it was, I guess from context it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a love of the different user interface elements? Was a little bit abstract and wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the gameplay itself necessarilyoverlyreinforced that, but still a cute idea and having the UI elements exhibit ranges of emotions over the course of the game was a nice touch. Fun variety of levels which broke the 4th wall in some good ways and a lot of mechanics introduced, nice!",
      "You realllly love making games with multiple levels!! Really enjoyed the story and game play, what a great game!!",
      "The story and the game in this were both great. The story was engaging and the game was just enough to keep me going.",
      "The storytelling is really good, I had to play it twice, because I found out how to walljump and fell out of the level once. Couldnt restart the level, so had to restart the game. But that wasnt a problem, because the story it told so good, I do like, how the level difficulty suddenly gets way harder, to underline the story.\u00a0\u00a0Great entry.",
      "That's a very original concept for a story game. And even though I didn't understand some plot points, I think got the overall idea. I like the U+I letters at the end, but I am not sure if that fits this task.\u00a0The amount of levels is impressive and I like how every level was different (the dark level was very hard, though!). All the art and animations are very pretty. Well done!",
      "I know on the discord you were saying story telling is hard and you didn't feel super confident about your entry, but honestly I think this tells a solid story really well!\u00a0 One of my favorite entries of the jam and one of my few full five stars!",
      "",
      "Usually making the UI work is my least favorite part of a game, but you seem to have done it well (:",
      "never have i felt so invested in UI before, great little story and fun concept",
      "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m impressed with how many levels there are and I especially liked the later levels with the spikes but the true star of the show was the ending. The way the letters come together was a nice touch and a really satisfying way to conclude the game"

      "Well there goes all 5 stars my friend! This was a great game that you can follow the story easily and the environment was fun to go through! Good job!",

      "The story is really enjoyable and well explained, so it is pretty clear. I love the gameplay, it's very original and fun, I like how every item had a different use. And the bossfight is very well designed, incorporating all the mechanics learned in the levels. The artstyle is really nice, I like how the whole game takes place on a scroll.\u00a0Great entry, it fits the task perfectly!",
      "Super fun and cute little game! I love the art and the overall aesthetic. I missed the sword the first time through and it took me a minute before I went back to grab it, maybe some effect or sign to let the player know they need to get it would be nice. Otherwise, great level design and good job overall!",
