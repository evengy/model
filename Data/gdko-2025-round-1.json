      "Clever use of mechanics.\u00a0 I like how hitting A and D created a rhythm, like a train on tracks. \u00a0I'm afraid I wasn't very good at this game, but I still enjoyed it.",
      "The game is true to form. Its a train. There are no problems. 10/10",
      "I'm not good enough to win, but I'm good enough to rate. Well done!",
      "Victory! One question - who plants those trees on my tracks!?",
      "This was cool. It took me a bit to figure out you needed to alternate A and D rapidly to get going, but once I did it was smooth sailing. I like the art style, I\u00a0think using the same base pixel size for the foreground and background would help it look a bit more cohesive. Nice work on this!",
      "Cool mechanic! Reminds me of the Pokemon Stadium minigame -\u00a0Run, Rattata, Run: Where you would have to mash a button then jump over the barriers. Similar concept, but implemented in an original way!I like the use of the mouse and keyboard, keeping both hands active.A bit of audio would tie it together nicely, but what you've submitted aligns with the task! Well done!",
      "",
      "Oh wow, I am not going to pretend that this was very fun but the creativity\u00a0of mechanics was a joy.",
      "Well, my fingers definitely got some exercise playing that ;P\u00a0 It's a very minimalist game that succeeds in completing the first task, but I wonder how you'd expand on it?",
      "I struggled to start initially (took me 3 attempts to move at all). But otherwise the game is a nice clear piece of game design, with a distinct art style. Well done.",
      "Petition to replace the no internet dino game with this",
      "Nice game! I love the 1 bit art style. I'm a sucker for minimalism",
      "Interesting mechanic that worked well. I struggled to get the train moving but ended up in the flow of it. I got soooo close to the station, i could see the edge of it but ran out of fuel \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ad",

      "Really cool idea ! Artstyle is original and works well.",
      "I like the art quite much, it's\u00a0simple but has so much personality in it at the\u00a0same time. I would like to see more games made with it!",
      "Cool and fun game. Spamming the keys with one hand and using the mouse to lift the trees and feed them to the train wore out my left hand.",
      "Very nice!\u00a0 I like the simple Artstyle, reminds me of Minit :)",
      "Train!",
      "Interesting art style. I like that you used the obstacles as fuel. The dragging feels smooth. I feel the two mechanics don't work so well together - I usually have to go really slowly to have time to remove the obstacles. Still, great job!",
      "I wasn't very good at this game, but I\u00a0enjoyed it! Occasionally I got random Game Overs when I don't think I\u00a0did anything, possibly it was when I was dragging the trees to the train. Nice work!!",
      "I believe this game has potential, keep developing friend!"

      "Loved the arrow sound\u00a0:D Fun game, good job!",
      "Nicw graphic and music. game was way to hard.",
      "The core mechanic felt very under cooked. There probably was supposed to be some sort of a arching mechanic but the white indicator didn't even feel like it was doing anything. The upgrades, besides the HP, didn't have much impact on the shooting either, so I don't really know what there is besides pressing mouse 1.",
      "Shooting arrows was fun even tho I rarely hit anyone, the game is also graphically nice.",
      "Cool game, nice\u00a0 sounds! :D",

      "The shooting was fun and the upgrading definitely helped with the progression. The game was fun, though I died on round 4.",
      "This is a great concept. I found the arrow shooting quite difficult, but could very well be a skill issue. I definetly want you to continue this project, and see where it goes. The mechanic is solid, good job.",
      "This is one of those games that I was terrible at and yet still really loved. \u00a0It's so cool defending your tower and choosing smart upgrades. \u00a0I really hope you continue this and enhance it.\u00a0\u00a0It was lots of fun.",
      "This was great, the upgrade system was by far one of my favorite parts along with the sound effects. looking forward to seeing future work on this",
      "I really enjoyed playing this arrow-shooting game! The upgrade system is engaging, the animations are smooth, and the sound design complements the gameplay well. The mechanics are solid and fun to interact with. Great work! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to see what interesting ideas you bring to future rounds. Keep it up!"

The particles flying everywhere look great, I started spamming a lot and got a bit of lag but the effect of all that destruction was really cool.",

      "Very fun game and the visual effects are great, especially when you crash.\u00a0I agree with what has already been said about the controls and it would make a massive difference to the gameplay. Nevertheless, I managed to get a high score of 11. I like how the enemy UFO can fly on a diagonal and all of the interactions with the asteroids are really great, overall a very solid entry",
      "Visual elements are good and mechanics are good fit to task, congrats! I found controls a little bit confusing bc it is unusual and I am not sure how to use pulling beam because asteroids didn't damage the enemy. Still it was enough to be good!",
      "The best I managed to do was to shoot one ship, I mean they are so good at shooting and I'm not very goot at positioning myself cleverly. But I like how you can't choose to go backwards, and how this is basically a game about multitasking simultaneously with asteroids and aliens. Good job!",
      "Like others have said, the controls were the biggest issue. To me at least the physic object rocks looked a bit wonky when just bouncing off of other objects. Maybe a bit too loud for my ears, but that is just a preference.",
      "Others have said this too, but intuitive controls would help!\u00a0 All in all though, I thought the movement was fun and unique, and it had solid potential!",
      "The explosion effect is cool. Using S to shoot is quite counter-intuitive. Was it chosen that way intentionally? It makes the\u00a0game\u00a0quite\u00a0challenging. Since the tractor beam can be used to hurt yourself I found it easier not to use it, and I ended up not using it at all. My\u00a0top score was\u00a07:",
      "The controls feel a bit unintuitive, but works well, nice job!",
      "Good start!",
      "i got addicted to this for a little while, ngl. i thought this submission was really cool. it's got this neat retro feel to it. the controls were a little awkward at first but i didn't really see what the big deal was. nobody said you had to make an easy game lol, the difficulty added to the fun for me. the movement and shooting (both fully automatic and precision) in themselves were fun, but the tractor beam adds a lot of character on top. i think a cool future addition would be additional heart pickups :) i hope you had fun making it, i'm coming back to this one.",
      "It made me feel like im controlling the ufo. The only problem is, i dont know how to control a ufo xD Good Job!",
      "Unfortunately my brain can't get a handle on the controls\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00a9",
      "I liked the style of the game and the effects. It's noticeable that you did your best)",
      "Nice Game but the other commenters are correct about the controls .",
      "Oh man it's frustrating, the game looks so cool but is unplayable for me, why did you choose such weird controls. I'll refrain from rating as the problem may be with me, I\u00a0just wanted to give this feedback.",
      "Cool little game. The controls were a bit awkward for me because I'm used to S being down, especially when w is up and d is right."

      "I cant believe you made this game in just 2 weeks. The game is fun and I like management games like this. I think there are some UI bugs because the toasts got cut off and some of the buttons or other messages also got cut off by other things on the screen.\u00a0It was a layering issue, not a resizing issue. Hopefully those get fixed. Will come back to this game to earn more money lol",
      "Loved this game!! I can't believe you made this in 2 weeks, it was incredible!! I had some trouble with zooming in and out, and scrolling in the ui panels, it was very glitchy for me. Asides from that, this was amazing! I would totally keep playing this if you decided to expand it in the future!",
      "Let's go gambling!! Jokes aside the game is incredible for something made in 14 days. Only negative I had were with the tutorial, it was not really needed as it didnt give crucial element or anything.",
      "The fact that you made this in two weeks feels fake. Incredibly well done. Can't wait to see you in round 2!",
      "This is a great sim game. No notes on getting the theme of the round down, great work!.",
      "This is crazy - crazy good. \u00a0How did you ever do all this? \u00a0I am so impressed. \u00a0It makes me wonder how I wasted so much time on my game. \u00a0Seriously though, this was so polished.\u00a0\u00a0The tutorial is amazing.\u00a0\u00a0This is first class. \u00a0I don't even love games like this and I enjoyed it.\u00a0 This is a definite winner!",
      "This is insane for a two week project. A crazy amount of work! I really like this type of game so I'm excited to see where this goes.",
      "The tutorials were the weakest part of the game honestly. Way too much text, inconstant sizing and just bland flavour text. Once the actual game started (which really didn't clear up by the end of the tutorial) it was a very simple drag and drop game with a memory game that really didn't click to me. The art style was consistent but a minus for generic AI generated music.",
      "This game is tooo good for the game-jam )",
      "One of the\u00a0 bests games out there,\u00a0 VERY complete for a 14 day release. I want to see this game in the next rounds with more mechanics and tweaks. Never thought I wanted an cassino management game but now I need one and it is right here.",
      "I think the game turned out very well. I'll be waiting for the sequel!)",
      "I\u00a0made it to Day 12, $87k earnings total, and 293 patrons. I'm glad I\u00a0played enough to unlock more rooms!",
      "i wasn't expecting the 3d space, that was an exciting surprise. i'm a little impatient with words so some of the exposition and the rules especially, i did start to skim and guess. the drag-and-drop animation, along with the\u00a0tile casino expansion, was really satisfying. i hope you had fun making it :)",
      "One of my favorites! So satisfying! You did a very good job!\u00a0:D",
      "You know it's a good game when you lose yourself in it.",
      "Awesome game! I genuinely would pay money for this game if developed further. If this round doesn't go to you then someone stuffed the ballots! Good job!",
      "I liked it a lotlove me some take people money and make us rich \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0088on serious note this is very well executed *chef kissid play this on a weekend morning just to chill and enjoy the day",
      "Love it, i hope you win and i hope you maybe bring it to steam because has a unique idea and you really made it grate and well made!",
      "Very well made and polished game. I enjoyed playing it and\u00a0also i like gambling too. I wish i could join the visitors))",
      "Very robust and nice looking game for something made in only 2 weeks! Very impressive!I think the gameplay loop is super fun, but may get bogged down a bit by too many surrounding rules + UI elements. At its core, very fun though!",
      "This game is so great. I hadn't checked it out cuz I thought it was a game where you play casino games, but once I saw it was a strategy game I was all in."

      "The initial controls were the biggest troll I've ran into this jam, the \"alt\" controls were so much better. The idea is quite good but I personally dislike these movement gimmick games where the map design really has to do all the heavy lifting. The sounds were quite loud as I had to lower my windows sound from 25 to 10 to not get an ear bleeding. +1 for an interesting main menu.",

      "This was very clever. \u00a0Also, agree with those who said it was hard - it was.\u00a0 Really original game!",
      "I'm not sure if I understood how to manage it correctly, but I really liked it)",
      "Such an awkward game that was completely fun. Tough game for me, but it was great.",
      "How on earth do people come up with these mechanics? (THIS IS A COMPLIMENT BECAUSE I AM AT AWE). This is so cool I\u00a0hope more people play this and this passes to round 2.",
      "Very interesting take! I love the both game mechanics and it was indeed hard!! But very challenging and fun also!"

      "This concept is so dope. Such a creative game, with great and simple rules. Can't wait to see you in round 2",
      "Wooh I LOVE the art. The gameplay is also very cool. First attempt I got to level three before I realized how the \"mana\" worked and got to level 7 the next time.\u00a0 Not entirely clear what killed me but it is very interesting!",
      "this has lots of potential! Im surprised how complex it can get with all the mechanics you added. Also the bee being sad when you attack it makes me sad :(",
      "It was more fun and advance that I first thought. Good job! I got to level 10 but I couldn't figure out how to save it to the leaderboard..",
      "Best game for me so far as I love card games and auto battlers, well done.",
      "This game is really awesome. I like the auto play of the cards and it was clear exactly what was happening. There was a strategy for picking cards and dropping some. I'd love to see where you take this game!",
      "Super cool game - I love it. Can't wait to see how you're going to develop this further (I hope you do). I really liked the graphics and animations and overall gameplay - super slick. Nice one!",
      "Cool game, It felt so good killing that bee on the start, revenge >:D",
      "One of the few games I played on repeat! All the different cards being able to carry different strategies, slowly building up a wicked deck of various types of cards, this game rocks!",
      "This is insanely fun and polished. You are definitely gonna go far this year.",
      "Great game!",
      "Love the game!! Love your art like always!! And such a great game\u00a0mechanic, it's very addictive and fun to play and try out different strategies!!",
      "Really well made ! I chose the poison way and i think it was pretty effective. But ... why ... why killing such cute bees ??!",
      "Really well-made game with good art style and all, seriously one of the best entries here,\u00a0but I feel like a murderer now.",
      "I really love it, the way on how we build our deck as the core and making the deck more effective through out the levels to complement the core is very fitting very cool concept!also poor bee\u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b2",
      "Very very fun and well done! Always have loved deckbuilders but not much experience with autobattlers, yet it works surprisingly really well here - I like how you have a couple different playstyles mixed into decks already (straight up damage + crit, poison, or even books)",
      "Another great game from you Loten! Super fun to play, really nice using Calculus to squash stuff! Very nicely executed, with unique art and fun jokes. Went for the book deck, will now explore the poison one.",
      "Gameplay loop is fun and easy to understand!Buuuut i feel bad hurting all the cute animals lol",
      "Very fun game - the combination of autobattler and deck builder feels great. I like the design of adding cards that do no damage but increase your gold. The tutorial could be more detailed, but the UI and game design helped me understand the game immediately. Great job!",
      "First off, I LOVE deckbuilders so I'm absolutely biased but I had a great time playing this. Honestly no criticisms from me,\u00a0 it's lacking some variety and a little bit repetitive\u00a0 but nonetheless I'm so hyped to see where this goes. This has reinvigorated my fixation on making a deckbuilder. I'm not fully sure what the primary and secondary mechanics are but they seem to be buying cards from the shop and combat. If you make it to round 2 please develop this further <3 It's already making my monkey brain happy seeing numbers go up and if/once there's more\u00a0\u00e2\u009c\u00a8juice\u00e2\u009c\u00a8 added I might get\u00a0addicted. Good luck!",
      "This was definitely one of my favorites. I recognize your art style from the 2024 GDKO video and I have a feeling you will go far again this year as well!",
      "This was incredible.\u00a0 Even in just a few rounds I was getting a sense for different strategies to lean into to get further.\u00a0 I could see this being a larger game for sure!\u00a0 Full five stars from me!",
      "Fun game! cool to see the bugs returning once more",
      "VEry good and very addictive! Almost feels polished as well!",
      "This was a lot of fun. It's pretty simple to figure out how everything works and it's so fun to get a juicy machine gun hit with a lot of buffs before it to wreck the enemies. Definitely seems like there's a lot of room to expand upon ideas in this one. I\u00a0ended up making it to wave 8 on my best run. Great job!",
      "Cool concept! I can see it goes further!",
      "This is a cool concept. I love deckbuilders and I think there is something here but it needs some tweaks. I guess enemies will attack at some point but I feel I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any control on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen the way it is right now. Maybe you could add some secondary mechanic during the battle itself to influence the result, maybe something as simple as skiping a drawn card to play the next with some penalty?",
      "Really fun cards, but would have liked to choose the card myself, really fun game though!",
      "I love deckbuilding games. I had fun playing this.",
      "Thank you for giving us this needed revenge that felt really good"

The collisions were extremely wonky and some of the bamboo sticks could even push you into the traps. Throughout the game I had no idea what any of the abilities did, so I never used them. The combat didn't have much going on and it resulted in just spamming attacks until something died.",

      "Satisfying! Maybe there could more levels and some progression with upgrading the ball weight, power etc..",
      "This was a lot of fun. It's a pretty simple mechanic, but it's executed well and the addition of the score and leaderboard really adds a lot to the game. I ended up playing it a few times to go for a high score and got 819 and 2nd place on the leaderboard. Great job!",
      "The mechanic is so simple But hell it's fun to play, It got me hooked for a while. I think you can still expand this a lot more, For example, regarding the big blue ball I thought at first that if you hit it with the normal ball it would break the walls in a bigger way (since it is bigger) I think that would be fun that you can hit other objects (balls or something else) and those objects react and break more wall creating more destruction and giving the player more score. I think you have something that has some room\u00a0 to grow and develop some entertaining and creative gameplay. Great job",

Throwing the basketball and dribbling it/bouncing it off of stuff was an absolute blast.\u00a0\u00a0I wish there was a bit more content but hey, it's round 1! The bricks feel a tiny bit too stiff in my opinion, but everything about the basketball feels perfect.",
      "Whoever has the 900 score must've figured out some ancient magic because I can't even get to mid 800s before the bricks are practically gone already. May not really fit the theme well, but it is a fun timewaster game on its own.",

      "The jump and run mechanics were implemented nice. although I would have seen each of them as their seperate mechanic. So wall jumping and dashing would already be 2 mechanics. The Boxes were a bit though to place in the lava but other than that a solid entry!",
      "This was fun. Found the controls to help with the frustration which added to the fun.",
      "Wall jumping is extremely satisfying. Sometimes it is hard to get through small gaps because of it but overall its great.",
      "Very nice smooth movement, character just pleasant to control )",
      "Epic stuff. Reached the end around 2:59 in the speed run mode. I Wish if it was less slippery especially when jumping on boxes placed on lava. 10/10 fun game though and cool mechanic with grabbing and throwing boxes. Well done!",
      "The controls feel nearly perfect! Everything felt so smooth and natural and the visuals are really nice as well! I also enjoyed all the various dialogue you put into the game. Overall a lot of meaningful choices that sum up to a superb platformer.",
      "love the wall jump mechanic both core and secondary pretty fitting and does complement wellloved it!",
      "Fun game! Thecontrols felt very nice which made it an enjoyable experience overall. The controls were a bit slippery, which was actually very fun\u00a0at some parts but the levels are designed at points to make you do precise movements, which don't feel good.\u00a0I feel like the dash was underused, especially since it just gets taken away from you at multiple points.\u00a0Although it adds more of a challenge, just removing the player's ability to do something doesn't feelgreatand I would also consider the fact that managing to skip parts of the level or do it in an unintended way is way more fun - even if it's way harder sometimes.\u00a0Also carrying the boxes felt a little bit weird and they were VERY easy to smuggle in different places throughout the levels. The main menu felt a little unintuitive, but it wasn't that bad. A lot of these are little nitpicks but I think my main issue was with the camera.\u00a0With the speed at which the player is going if you head in a direction the camera lags behind you, leaving only ~15% of the screen focused on where you're actually going. I see you're using unity and would guess you are using cinemachine, maybe increase the lookahead time in the body of the camera? I usually do that for my games.",
      "Great job! I even had a go on the speedrun mode and managed a time of around 3 minutes.\u00a0Really solid entry.",
      "The movement controller felt great, but dropping the boxes of felt a bit finicky/buggy at times. I that you had like a secret extra level inside the portal, it surprised me! I also liked that you incorporated some story elements.",
      "This is a really good game with some very challenging jumps and feats. I really liked it, and the signpost character was well-written too. Good stuff. Billy World rules!",
      "Man, you checked all boxes! a very solid entry, straight to the point. And\u00a0I liked how many elements (double jump, wall jump) you implemented and all very well! I appreciate the tutorial, was well done as well. The level design is clear and I like the dynamic feel of the game. Really great job, 5/5!",
      "Fantastic Game! You improved it so much since last time I played it! The only problem was that I\u00a0struggled to get out of the settings. Otherwise, game is Awesome! Love to see more :D",
      "this was fun to play. i thought the menu could be more intuitive, i did get stuck a couple times before i got the game going. i wanted lest left-ride slide, but that could easily just be a personal preference.\u00a0the environment was engaging yet classy, my favorite part was the secret level. I hope you had fun making it :)",
      "Great platformer! The player character is very cute. Some small platforms feel a little too slippery. Maybe you could make them slightly bigger than they actually are. But still, very good game!",
      "Very nive platfromer game with elements of puzzles, haha. Well done!",
      "cute and buttery smooth!",
      "love the player! very lovely! billy is love billy is life, i dont really like how the tilemap doesnt at all go with the player, but with a change of tiles i could see this getting successful, good luck!",
      "Super cute! The idea has a lot of potential, and the premise of being a little blobby experiment guy gives things a fun sci-fi twist. I didn't love the character movement-- it felt very slippery and unwieldy, flying over platforms and bouncing off of walls in a manner that felt uncontrolled. I also really wanted to remap my box-grabbing key a lot of the time to something easier to use alongside WASD, like ctrl or shift.",
      "Such a charming game!! i like the spanish speaking box",
      "I'm normally pretty terrible at games like this. \u00a0But this was some of the best implemented wall-jumping I've seen and your tutorial and check-points were both incredibly helpful. \u00a0Well done!",
      "This was a fun platformer! I like the movement a lot it feel well implemented and the wall jump is great. I agree with what someone said about the boxes and the lava below, but I think that's my only constructive criticism for the game. Great work on this I think I played thru everything including the secret world!",
      "Love the walljump it legit is the best feeling walljump ive felt ina\u00a0 platformer rn, really cool game!!",
      "Movement and jump are very well implemented. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so fun.",
      "I could see myself playing this game. I would tweak a couple things around the boxes in the lava, they float away too easily, kept falling because the boxes moved under my feet, also, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow to pick the box if you are standing on it because again, I kept falling in the lava. After that segment the rest was very enjoyable.",
      "nice platformer! I liked the story behind it too"

      "I loved it, got to 163 score! I think it could be expanded to be even better!",
      "The blocking and parriyng\u00a0mechanics feels great. As for the game (I know this is a prototype, but in a jam one has to evaluate it as a game as well),\u00a0I can't say I didn't had fun, thanks to parrying mechanics feeling good,\u00a0but the challenge was clearly missing, the difficulty is increasing too slowly to make effect.",
      "Very GOOD job. 5/5",
      "very good This mechanism also appears to have great potential for integration and expansion into other genres.",
      "Very cool Idea, I believe this was one very nice prototype and I can see this idea developing into a full game with cool mechanics and engaging story. I would love to see levels in which arrows are throw at you in a puzzle way so each time you\u00a0 try to parry or block them you have to think of the order of the arrows or which action you have to do. Very cool keep it up.",
      "Very fun parry game and I think you could really make something cool. There are some things that need work but I saw in other comments that you mostly focussed on the main mechanics (100% okay to do so btw). So some feedback on your main mechanic, the parry is nice and I love the intro. I do wish the enemies would spawn and attack faster cus sometimes you mess up and you just stare at the fucker for 10 seconds. The sound feedback is great thoSo with some work I do think this could be real fun!",
      "Deflecting the arrows felt really nice and satisfying, but I wish that the game had more mechanics",
      "Very neat, first and foremost great job!",
      "The initial experience was great (besides the tutorial in the menu not working) but the difficult ramped up too slow in my opinion. By the time I got to 20 score there really wasn't anything new but played to 70 to see if anything would appear, but no. It also felt weird how I hadn't died yet and just to confirm I didn't play and sure enough, you can't die.\u00a0Props for having audio at 50% and not full like most other games.",
      "i loved it manit felt so good deflecting those arrows",
      "Really enjoy playing this!! The mechanics are great, and super original! Amazing job!! :)",
      "The mechanic works quite well and definitely fulfils the task.",
      "pretty well made for a first round of gdko, I could safely say your going to round 2 \u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00a1\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aa",
      "Very fun base mechanic, it felt extremely satisfying throughout the whole experience! I think you nailed the audio and visual cues as others have said, it was all intuitive and made sense. Only minor thing was that the mouse sensitivity didn't seem to change even as I lowered it in the settings, but that should be a quick fix",
      "Wow you really pulled through with this! The timing feels great, and I love the use of both audio and visual cues to guide the player to spot the snipers. Also, bravo on the hilarious voice acting!",
      "this is pretty well made for the idea that you're going intoboth core and secondary fits pretty wellreally well executed loved it!for 5 minutes straight didnt manage to perfect parry and got 0 killsim glad i didnt take samurai as my dream job",
      "The troll creature in the beginning is 10/10, look at him fly.",
      "The mechanics were super good! I felt that they aligned well. However, I felt a bit bored on the first levels",
      "Mechanics felt so smooth. I liked the VFX of slowmo. It was challenging, but it was more interesting to play when there was a lot of archers. Well done!",
      "Love a game that's all about parrying!",
      "The mechanics fit each other well. It was a little tough to get started but once I got it down it was great. I'd like to see you continue to develop\u00a0this. Great job!",
      "Really love the mechanics and being able to shoot the arrow back at the enemy!",
      "Very cool prototype. The graphics look nice and the parrying feels great. I really like the sound effects and slow down that happens when you do the perfect block, killing the dudes feels awesome. I think it'd be cool if\u00a0the difficulty were to ramp up faster or if it became a game where you could move around and stuff too if you kept working on it. Great job!"

      "Cool puzzle game! It was a bit hard to understand, the first bit was easy, but once you got to the numbers it got a bit confusing. I understood I had to match symbols, but I pressed a cat that made three sounds and I\u00a0didn't really understand how that made sense. I also thought I got the correct answer when they turned red at first, but once I\u00a0saw the numbers being formed being green I understood how it all worked.",
      "I had no clue what was going on the first time so I decided to refresh the page to start over, but now it errors out and refuses to start again, even after multiple refreshes \" Error: Couldn't load project data at path \".\". Is the .pck file missing? If you've renamed the executable, the associated .pck file should also be renamed to match the executable's name (without the extension).\"The idea was interesting but could've used a lot more clarifying elements.",

      "This was cool! I like the art a lot the cats are so cute and the blobby things are cute too. I think I was too dumb to understand the puzzles, I managed to get my degree by guessing everything and just dragging stuff around til I got the correct solution lol. Great job on this!",

I was so lost there at first, just mindlessly clicking cats like \"???\" and it didn't help that I basically guessed the first cats without any mistakes :')\u00a0But then I got it and it all made sense (I think) (I hope). Also, the slime cats are very cute.",

I managed to understand the game, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if I fully understood the degree part. Is it the green-colored one you get after adding the correct numbers? If so, I think I got it! Overall, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a super creative and quirky concept\u00e2\u0080\u0094great work!"

      "The movement was a bit weird to figure out as further the mouse was from middle the faster you moved, but also, at least to me, it felt like horizontally moving was faster than vertical movement. After getting hit by the ghosts the movement speed never reset, so you are stuck with what you have. Also also pressingANYbutton on your keyboard teleports you back, no clue why only space is mentioned as even numpad works.",

      "Cute and fun game that really puts the crunch on you when you're nearing the end time. One constructive comment I'd say is to maybe make the option menus visible when the icon is hovered instead of having to click it, (although that could just be me as I am playing on a laptop and using a mousepad).",

      "This is a cool idea, it would have been helpful to get some intrutcions because it took me a second to figure out what i was doing but not bad.",
      "Really cool idea!\u00a0 It took me a second to realize that I could walk through the green area on the left to find the film reels, so I could've used a little more instructions, but this is a solid start!",
      "Love the idea of having to use the camera to take the photo and use that film to place it where you need it to progress to the next level! Would love to see what you do next!",
      "Very nice start! I thought the door on the left was a window at first :P",
      "It was confusing at first, and a little short. I would definitely like to to seem more of this, maybe you could have it\u00a0without objects being removed from the scene.\u00a0 Like I'm taking a picture, not moving it.\u00a0Cool concept though!",
      "The concept is interesting and I'd love to see this concept get taken somewhere. Good luck!",
      "I liked the concept of taking pictures of items to use them elsewhere, and it is definitely a mechanic I'd like to see expanded on! It currently operates more like a standard inventory where you take objects from one place to another. At the same time, having film rolls act as\u00a0\"single use\" inventory slots is an interesting change that could make for cool puzzles!",
      "I like the concept, but I felt that it was a bit confusing, especially the window.",
      "I want to preface this by saying I love the idea you have going here. Capturing objects into pictures and using them later to solve puzzles is a brilliant concept for a game. However, I don't think the game encapsulates the mechanics you described. Don't get me wrong, the mechanics are certainly there, it just doesn't feel like I'm taking a photo, rather just picking the objects up. What I would have done is made the mouse the camera, putting an outline around it that acts as the \"frame\" of the photo, then using left click to collect the objects, rather than simply walking up to the objects and pressing a button. Again, I love the idea you have, I just would have implemented the mechanics differently if I were you."

      "good relaxing game. i would like to see what max weight of fish i build in tab menu.",
      "Had maybe a bit too much fun with the boat movement as it could build up a lot more speed than probably intended. The fishing unfortunately bugged out and I couldn't enter that mode after just clicking to reel in the fish, which was apparently supposed to be hold reel in. Cute pixel graphics and fitting audio.",
      "This is a nice little cozy game. Just chilling on the water catching some fish. I\u00a0do have to mention, that the boat movement is reversed to the rowing animation, it should be the other way around. Other that that good job.",
      "Rowing was fun, I couldn't get any fish. Seemed like I could never click fast enough after the bite. Good set of mechanics though. Good game!",

      "fish",
      "Super fun! I love fishing in video games. This one took me a minute to figure out, but after a couple of tries I was fishing like a pro! Rowing around was fun too, especially once I realized that with the right inputs I could send my little rowboat careening through the water with reckless abandon",

      "This was great. A genuine great prototype. I\u00a0would love some islands to navigate around.",

      "A cool fishing game! When the music came in for some reason I just started smiling. Each oar being A and D made it fun to just drive my little boat around. Good job!",
      "I loved this game. The vibe is so chill, and I love the 3d/2d blended style you have going on. I wish the fish would head towards the lure easier, it was a bit of a pain to get the lure to their path (skill issue I know lol). But yeah, great great fishing game and use of 3d models."

The shop took quite long to figure out as I couldn't buy the ones I specifically wanted but it turned out to be chance based.",

      "The mechanics are there and they are fun. I liked the crafting mini game. Well done!",
      "I love the minigame its real fun, the game itself works but could use some polish. The artstyle is cute and the overall gameplay loop is fun only issues I have is that a few things seem unecesary. The energy part for sleep does not do much besides refilling maybe making trees respawn or smth makes this a necesity. Also crafting being inside of the house maybe if you could place the things you create that would make sense but now the house doesnt feel like it contributes a lot.All of these things are of course not that hard to fix and for a round 1 you did a very good job. I see you apologizing that the game is unpolished and I just want to say, be proud of what you made over 1000 people joined and only 200 managed to finish and you are one of them. Gamejam entries have a lot of bugs (even mine ) and thats okay.Gl if i see you in the next round and otherwise gl with the rest of your journey!",
      "The crafting mechanic was quite unclear as I kept connecting the lines but for most of the tries it just refused to connect. After crafting whichever wood thing you chose you could still keep drawing even if it probably does nothing. The energy mechanic for some reason resets when you exit the building. In my opinion the cutting part should've stayed on space instead of mouse 1 as it is never explicitly told what to press and space just happened to be the last one.Cute art style in the few areas that had art, but the gameplay was extremely thin.",
      "Congrats on managing to make a proper crafting game for a jam. It was cute and enjoyable. There was a bug where bronze axe wasn't doing what it says, it was cutting juniper tree instead, but that doesn't matter. Loved the crafting minigame, inventive.",
      "very interesting overall, the timings of minigames are a bit finicky.",
      "Two minigames complement each other well, many features and potential things to update in the future.\u00a0Overall, a good game worth trying out!\u00a0The only confusing thing was that when cutting trees it told me to press space when I had to press left mouse button, luckily I figured that out before leaving. Good job.",

      "Great game! The sword as both an attack and platform to jump on is very clever. The art style is very cute too. Great job!",
      "This was a lot of fun! I like the mechanic of throwing your sword and bouncing off it. It was a lot of fun to chain it and bounce up walls with it. I think the spike hitboxes were a bit large and coyote time on the jump would've been nice. Overall really enjoyed this, great work!",

      "Great concept for a platformer! Loved the jumping/bouncing mechanic on the stick, really sets it apart from a traditional platformer. Art style was captivating also!",

      "Fun and Cute. Well done. I would only change the jump button (like space bar) but just a personal preference...",

      "Cute little platformer! Was very fun once I got used to the controls. You picked out some nice art and music too. Pretty much my only critiques would be the ones Brainfart gave on his game dev stream with the game's handling. But otherwise, very fun, I would love to see this game continued.",
      "Overall fun can cute game. Controls were a bit finnicky for me as I am typically used to using spacebar to jump. Some puzzles were great in that they could be solved multiple ways.",
      "Great game, cute graphics and the mechanics were fun.\u00a0 I had a hard time with the controls, not used those, would have preferred jumping not being the same hand as the moving.",
      "I liked the combo of having the sword be both a weapon and a jump assist!\u00a0 Good concept and execution.\u00a0 My only minor complaint is that the hitbox on the spikes seemed a little big, but that only really came into play in the first area for a second where I felt like I should be safe but still died.",

I like blowing the leaves around and it's very hectic trying to get them all into the truck in time but fun! I like the art a lot, especially the animation of the truck spitting out a coin, it was the best. It's also a very polished jam game. Great work on this!",
      "Honestly this is a perfect jam game, and my favourite in this jam I've played so far. It has a unique and fun mechanic, presented in a stylish way, with good art and some storytelling. Also the fact that you don't even have to be good at it, you'll still progress and get to see all the levels is such an underrated thing for jam games, I do not want to be stuck on a level at all, so that you have a star system is great! Also I love the world map, it adds so much.Only critique is that I didn't really feel the need for the shop or the power ups, it was fun anyways! I didn't even understand how to use the item I bought before at the end when I read the description (I thought you were supposed to click on it)",

The physics based action was fun, silly and chaotic leading the the levels being a frantic rush to tidy up. I especially liked the implications with the extension cord and giving the player a short time on battery was a nice touch to allow for some strategy!",

      "What a great clean up game. Loved the mechanics and think you nailed the challenge for the round. It was tough but a lot of fun. Great game!",
      "Chaotic in all the best ways!\u00a0 This was an incredible amount of polish for two weeks, and one of my favorite entries of the round!\u00a0 Great job!!",
      "Great concept and foundation of a game! I felt at times that the direction litter gets blown was a little finnicky, but I may have had to get used to it a bit more. I loved the art style and general theming though, very cool game! If you wanted to expand on this, I could easily see some cool new map mechanics you could implement, more powerups, and stuff like that",
      "I think this is a great prototype. Everything fits together the way you want it to. I\u00a0think the only thing it's lacking is more levels! I\u00a0want more!",
      "The graphics and gameplay were on point with this one. Didn't really get what the secondary mechanic was as it wasn't told anywhere but probably could've been the upgrading which I never used. The cable mechanic was a nice addition but it also didn't seem to have much use besides some edge cases.",
      "I love the little trash eater character! def 100000 points for creativity and execution so going in my top 5",
      "Really great entry! I had a lot of fun playing this one. Cleaning up the city was kinda meditative. I definetly want to see this one developed further. The power ups were in my opinion not so impactful.",
      "I liked\u00a0 the game a lot!\u00a0Tho I would rather increase the strength of the blower and make the leaves go wild, instead of having them this \"stiff\" and hard to give air time.",
      "very well balanced and very fun mechanics! I would play a complete game of this :) Nice work!",
      "Ah yes, this is a banger!",
      "What a fun game. Simple to pick up, plenty of levels, and a pretty art style. An overall great time!",
      "very fun\u00a0mechanic i really enjoyed the game( almost 5 stars for each levels) and it has good graphisms with a\u00a0\u00a0retro , smooth , and cartoony\u00a0 art style\u00a0\u00a0( i'm\u00a0 using\u00a0 my own words don't have design knowledge )\u00a0 , the only inconvenient in the game is that the shop is not that usefull for now ."

      "Dat is a unique idea! NOT the easiest one",
      "Very nice and unique concept! Well done! :D",
      "Very fun game, I actually ended up spending a long time trying to get these damned colors to fit together. I saw that you intend on working on the difficulty curve, which would be great because, I'm no artist, and right now this game is HARD man.",
      "It was fun trying to mix the colors, my kid liked the guy in the picture. I\u00a0had a lot of fun playing this game, well done.",
      "Fun game but really hard, maybe i'm not good with color decomposition :D",
      "This was fun, I learned that I am good at getting close to making the right color but I am always like 1 off lol. I liked that it told you the answer after you failed so you could learn how to actually make the color because I really wasn't sure for some of them. Idk if it'd make it too easy, but I found myself wishing I could remove the color I just mixed in when I saw what the result was and I was clearly not going in the right direction. Great work on this!",
      "Finally! My random knowledge of color mixing is useful! Although, my knowledge seems to be lacking to a substantial degree. I really love games that choose to become some really out there niche type of gameplay. This game is a certified banger!",
      "At first, the controls seemed a bit too fast. However, after some playtime, they felt really fun. I enjoyed grabbing the colors and quickly dragging them around. A timer and score system would add a lot to this game. I hope you continue to develop it\u2014great job!",
      "Very interesting game\u00a0!\u00a0 Sometimes it is super easy, sometimes very hard. I have no idea how you make mud ! )))",
      "I practically failed colour theory at age 16, so this was a bit of a struggle. Once I got a bit warmed up with the controls and mechanics it paced well but there was a real lack of progression. No clue why the colours had the names over them if there are only the main big colours that everyoneshouldknow.",
      "I actually really liked mixing colors together to make complicated combitations and wishing I get them right.\u00a0I really want to see this game\u00a0grow and get more meta gaming like story and more polished graphics. I can actually see this being a cozy full-priced\u00a0indie game some day, inform me when that happens pls.",
      "I enjoyed playing it. Im not that good in color theory, but i got some good win streak. Mechanics are implemented very well. Nice game!",
      "I really dug this game. it feels very clean and sophisticated, with the nice groovy bassline and primary colors floating around. It was also educational - I never knew what colors made up copper, now I do! Very cool. The tank controls were a bit jarring to use at first, but it's an interesting mix of styles. I would guess that building this game is a good\u00a0learning experience as well.",

      "Game worked well, and didn't feel too easy or hard. I love the detail with giving the colours names. But I had a bug where if I picked up the colour at the deposit box, I had to leave and then enter again for it to drop of the colour.",
      "I like the idea, but I wish that there was something that said what colors you use to make some of the more complex colors, like burnt sienna",
      "I noticed that I am not good with colors lol. It was fun and addictive tho, well done!"

      "567 without getting any fuel or shooting as I thought the game didn't have anything besides moving, whoops. The objects being physics objects was a bit wonky, especially when the rocks would only get pushed, not destroyed. A short and sweet retro game.",
      "I really like top down shoot 'em ups, been playing them since the 90's. I think this game has a lot of potential but I think the hit detection was more than a bit too wide. Other than that, I think it's a fun game.",
      "As people have said here, solid start!\u00a0 It was a pretty simple game but it met the prompt well.\u00a0 My only advice would be if you continue this game for future rounds, find something to give it a little razzle-dazzle to help it feel fresh since there are tons of space shooters out there.",

      "I really enjoyed playing this! The concept is excellent, and the core gameplay is engaging.\u00a0 However, I initially struggled to understand how the cards worked. A brief introductory tutorial explaining their functions would significantly improve the onboarding experience.",

      "Incredible fusion between your two mechanics, both of which are well executed. Falling down that hole in the dark only to discover that you had made a card to help the player escape was a great moment.\u00a0The graphic juxtaposition between the two sides of the screen is a little harsh, so the two halves almost don't feel like they are part of the same game. Good luck!",
      "I really liked the concept and making it quick to switch the skills by having it right there the whole time. As far as judging the game by the criteria, I think you did fantastic. I'd like to see this game expanded on.",
      "This was a very cool game concept. I had some trouble with the camera and the light levels, but it definitely had strong bones, especially for a game jam game. At first I was very confused, but once I figured it out I thought it was very cool to go around collecting cards and getting new moves for my character! Good Job!",

      "This is one of my favorite genres. The digging mechanics are very well implemented, these sounds and effects are very satisfying. I went through all the levels and pumped up all the abilities)) This is a very cool game. The only thing I would add is that the camera seems to shake a little when the character moves. But this is just a prototype, so the game is excellent! 5/5",
      "so awesome! one of the nicest mining implementations i've played. i love how fast it is, especially once you upgrade. there was a slight bug sometimes when I was really heavily mining and walking around, i would kind of teleport a few tiles in one direction or another. Really really solid entry, nice work!",
      "very fun, almost addictive, made me forget i have another 190 games to vote, very good game!",
      "This reminded me of an old game called Motherload. I kept digging and digging and the progression felt so organic! Love the work and I hope you will keep working on this gem. Cannot wait to see larger area to dig, more resources and maybe some element of danger.",
      "Satifying gaem",

      "I loved this game. It has such a nice sense of progression and it's so fun to just destroy the whole screen once you get all the god tier upgrades. This was such a satisfying game, I would've absolutely played more if there was more of it. I think some music and some more involved mechanics would really make this game shine. Great job on this I had a lot of fun playing thru it!",
      "Great work, feels great to play. The main mechanic of mining ore is so satisfying,\u00a0and I love the addition of the\u00a0upgrade mechanic on the laser. I'm definitely anticipating a top 10 finish and I'd really love to see the game developed further.",
      "Maybe my favorite game so far just in terms of gameplay experience. The progression felt almost perfect.\u00a0Every upgrade, except for maybe the movement ones, felt impactful but not overpowered.\u00a0Never did the grind become too tedious or time consuming and by the time I was razing the entire final level it felt well-earned instead of a byproduct of really op upgrades. The amount of juice was perfect and made it insanely satisfying. There was definitely some lacking variety but I'd love to see more stuff in later rounds, assuming you get through and want to continue work on this. Amazing job!",
      "Super juicy mechanics. Great progression. I got all the upgrades and it was super fun just spinning around and chewing up the rocks and ore.",
      "this game is TOO GOODCrunchwrap Supreme levels of crunch. Art, Sounds, Mechanics, everything 10/10",
      "The game looks great, love the color palette you chose. The mining feels great and smooth. I like how powerful you can get after purchasing all the upgrades. Looking forward to this game if you decide to expand it in future rounds. Great job!",
      "Perfect progression! Very rewarding and satisfying, got me hooked too",
      "Such an addicting game, I love it! And need more levels!!! The mining, collecting, and skill tree is such a good combination!!",
      "This kind of game gets me hooked xD",
      "I think the mining and collecting mechanics were great and made this fun to play. The upgrades were also good and related to the first. I wasted too much time cleaning up the entire level before moving on. Fun game!",
      "The amount of joy I felt upgrading my little foxie to MAXIMUM ROCK DEATH was euphoric. If you ever make it into a full game I really hope it's like a factorio style industrial game because then my life would be complete.",
      "This was such an amazing and addictive game! Really had a great time, spent soo much time playing! Would love to see this game expanded further!! There was one glitch I ran into a few times where I got teleported to the top of the map, not really sure why, but I didn't get trapped, I just did more mining lol!!",
      "I love this game so much! \u00a0Not gonna lie, played it for almost half an hour and got every upgrade.\u00a0 I was a rock killing machine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not even sure why it was so additive, but it was.\u00a0\u00a0Perfect score.\u00a0\u00a0I want more!",
      "This was fabulous! I really hope that you continue to develop this game. I had so much fun just chillin' and collecting rocks :)",
      "Games like this remind me how great simple gameplay can be when it's polished and cohesive.\u00a0 The amount of time I spent enjoying this game considering I'm trying to rush through 200 games says a lot about how much you not only nailed the prompt but made something really fun!\u00a0 That's five stars across the board from me!",
      "I played a whole extra round where I cleaned up the whole screen after I got all the powerups, strangely meditative.I think this game has a lot of potential to expand on for future rounds.",
      "Honestly surprised by how good this was just based on hownotgood the thumbnail is. The progression was nice, good sound effects and no ear blasting music looping in the background. With some story or enemies, just more gameplay, this could easily be in the top 10 that this jam has had to offer (at least personally out of 70ish games)."

      "i like the game , the game screen could be a little bigger , sometimes my mouse quit the game window which prevent me from\u00a0\u00a0moving properly . Besides that it's a cool game prototype with potential ; with some more mechanics focused on\u00a0 dungeon exploration it could become a great game .",
      "When playing this, I liked to imagine that all the enemy deaths were the result of the protagonist accidently bumping into them and he was like \"oops! ... sorry... ... oops!... not again.... oops!\"",
      "The two mechanics worked very well together. Got a little too excited and lost my mouse and died on the third floor. Good game!",
      "Honestly felt a bit too easy. The level design may be to blame for that but the reach and field of vision was very generous in giving a warning when to start spinning which also didn't have any negative effect on the player, so spin away to your hearts contents.",
      "Fun and unique mechanic. Would be cool to focus on the swing so that the enemy are only killable when the player swing the sword",
      "It would be nice not to kill me right away haha, I would like the player to move a bit faster or be able to run for example. But the mechanics are interesting.",
      "Very nice job! :D",
      "I haven't seen this kind of a mechanic before. Swing attack is a good concept and love that the player lack the vision. But while playing it I felt that it could be a bit more dynamic, because for me it felt a bit too slow. Otherwise, great job!",
      "Love the dynamic between attacking and movement!\u00a0It makes for so much tense gameplay every single time you walk into a new room. It's also so fun to wildly swing your mouse around to defend yourself! Great game, but I wish there was more.",
      "Really interesting twist on top down\u00a0combat!\u00a0These mechanics definitely add\u00a0a\u00a0lot\u00a0of\u00a0tension when navigating the space.  Killing the enemies is satisfying with the blood splatter effect.",
      "I managed to escape the house. I like the unique mechanics and they work really well together. The music and deep breathing\u00a0captures the unsettling atmosphere perfectly",
      "Interesting mechanics that you showcased well. I can definitely see some potential for a horror game here. I'm really interested to see where you take this game next!",
      "I thought I was playing as a mouse for some reason :') But really interesting way to implement a view of field, could also work as first person game if you wanted to make it truly a\u00a0horrifying experience.",
      "Very unique gameplay!"

      "A fun weird game, and I love it. It's got some decent mechanics. Good game.",
      "Very cool art style, not quite as insane as your other game from the jam (also how on earth did you make 2 games for this jam), but it's awesome nonetheless. I like the crazy fast movement, tho it does get a bit hard to control at times. I think I made it thru the whole game, I killed everything on the level with the cover art guys all over the place and didn't see anywhere to go after that. Great work on this!",
      "The visuals are one of my favorites, they are charming and create this mysterious atmosphere with surprisingly good animations and effects. Gameplay wise alright too, maybe requires some more unique mechanics to actually stand out from other platformers - even though art already manages to do that.",
      "I\u00a0really like this. The visuals are like something from a fever dream. I\u00a0love the song, too. Great atmosphere. The wall jumping felt good (though the acceleration was a little intense)\u00a0and the attacks were impactful. I hope you get to continue on because I feel like this could go somewhere interesting :)",
      "The art style is probably giving a bad first taste for players as this one has some good gameplay mechanics. I got \"stuck\" at the spawn of the first level as I honestly had no idea why I couldn't move, but the respawning spot just happens to be right in-between two blocks which makes moving left or right impossible. The controls weren't exactly what I would've expected but got over it quite fast. Well done all-in-all.",

      "The mechanics are there, staying on the road and texting. Those two together were challenging. I think the game has more potential, good work!",
      "While the idea is there the actual implementation seems like a bit a hit-or-miss. The bar seems to float around either very wildly or get stuck at the edge. By the first gas station on the third try I was already quite bored as I had only gotten one message and at the second I crashed instantly as I looked down. It was a relief there was a timer on the bar instead of just instantly doing it, but the gameplay was rather stale regardless.",
      "Very creative. Personally, I would have made the messages appear faster and require fewer keys to be pressed because I was reaching the goal before sending a single message.",

      "Nice graphics and good game! I kinda got some bugs where my character flew across the screen, and a few times where it seemed like i was on a treadmile without me actually being on one :P",

One criticism I do have is that the movement feels a bit slow and the combat is finnicky, but it's not that big of a deal in the long run. I recommend searching how input buffering works in video games. Still, I would love to see your ideas expanded on.",

      "I really like this game! The style and music are awesome, and the spin on the classic mechanic of frogger is awesome too.The combat mechanic is the most unorthodox/innovative part, and at first it was unintuitive to walk into an enemy to attack them. However, once it became clear, partially due to the nice clean sword swing animation, it was a cool, minimal way to do combat.\u00a0I have one suggestion to kind of mitigate this, which is to have the very first enemy you kill be one that just wanders around and can't even hurt you. then the player will learn how to attack without the risk of failing before they know what they're doing. you can also have destructible crates/objects that can get the point across as well.but anyway, i really liked the gameplay and aesthetics of this!!!",
      "This was fun! I like the mix of frogger with some fighting in it. I really like the art style and the crt effect made it look so cool. I found myself a little frustrated by the fighting, I wasn't ever able to consistently kill a bat without taking damage so I ended up not making it past the 3rd level when there were more than 3 bats lol. Great job on this it's fun!",
      "Solid game with great and consistent graphics. It would be awesome to see the secondary mechanic developed further in a later round. Good luck!"

      "The game idea is cool, visuals and specially that sqake sound is spot on. One funny thing i found in the game is: if duck gets too close to shark it will raise above the see level and after it can climb on top of island. I think its minor bug adding gravity or restricting duck movement in only 2 axis will solve this. that being said I very much enjoyed this bug too.\nBehold the almighty duck carpenter descended form the havens:",

      "Duck!Anyways, I love your submission overall. It's a very cute idea! I also loved the various messages you hid around the game. One critique I have is that it was still very easy to find the wood pieces scattered around the sea without the flashlight mechanic, and I didn't really end up using it. But other than that, great game! I would love to see this expanded upon."

      "Loved Your Game, Your game perfectly fulfills the primary and secondary core mechanics!\nthis type of unique games I always like to play. Amazing Work.",
      "This game is awesome. You definitely have a the gift of making a game funny! The tutorial bullies had me rolling. Really really cool project!",
      "Fun and polished Game!",
      "Wow, what a delight. I love the stle of this game and how all the art really comes together. For some reason i really loved the representation of how long you had left being a wheel in the corner and it was cool to see the lighting change with it.A tutotorial is always nice in a game jam game and was happy to see you had one. It was clear, simple and did the job.... and then i saw there was an interactive tutorial level too!? AMAZING! It also really helped to add more charm and character to add to the art style. The tutorial bugs throwing shade was a lot of fun and i think it demonstrated the concepts well.",
      "Man, this is perfection! You need to continue this, I loved the idea",
      "Ah, it was very fun ))) And challenging! The first level was pretty easy, but the second forced me to restart a couple of times )",
      "Really unique and interesting mechanics! There is a lot of game here and some really interesting systems, I'm not even sure how you implemented the collision for jumping it works really well and fits the shape of the ball. Wild.Awesome job!",
      "The style was the strongest in this one, but going by the tutorial I expected a story game instead of this PVE-type of arena rolling. Even the bubbles were there, it could've been. Sometimes the bots like to get stuck and do nothing, but in the larger map they at least tried to win.",
      "The tutorial level is the greatest level in the game, I need a longer story campaing for this game (something metroidvanish maybe). Aesthetics, art and theme are all 10/10, one of my favorites by now. PVP is also a fun addition as a game mode.",
      "Good use of shader aesthetically good design, I don't know why but I just keep smiling when I play it I guess it's been so long since I played a cute games like this, I'll be discovering more other genre of games because of this thanks for inspiring me.everything works perfectly the rolling speed the hill push and sometimes the mushroom is op when climbing but I like it, the\u00a0only complain I have is the camera controls other than that a solid entry \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aa\u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00a1",
      "PEAK DUNG!!!, LOVE THE CARTOONY OUTLINE\u00a0 SHADER!!! AND ALSO THE CARTOON LIGHTING MODE I LOVE PUSHING DUNG, full 5 starss!",
      "The art style is amazing. I love how you made the tutorial level. The gameplay feels very smooth. I love how some items you roll over give you new abilities.",
      "Nice and cute game. It was fun to play and collect those items. Was a little confused how to correctly jump with umbrella, but then i figured it out, lol. Well done. I hope to see your game in next rounds!",
      "Good stuff. I really like how most items have abilities like bounce, slow and other fun things. Took the magnet and stood next to the others while they are fighting on the jump pad for some reason and dropping all their items. Would this strategy work in multiplayer? We well find out in the next round.Epic game with cool vibrant aesthetic and fun gameplay. Good job!",
      "This was fun, the art style was cool! Will be fun to play with friends and see who gets the largest dung.",
      "First one played on stream!\u00a0\u00a0And man, was it fun.",
      "I liked everything about this game and can see this as a fun party game or online multiplayer game. Very well done!",
      "Art style and visuals are fantastic!\u00a0reminds me of risk of rain 2",
      "it passed the vibe check with flying colors, really loved all the polish",
      "I would definitely see an online party game with theses mechanics",
      "I'm gonna admit i got mad at the camera at some point. Very fun game ! The vibes is great and i want to play more level !",
      "This is a very\u00a0cool game, very fun and easy to learn. I played this before the deadline and I am surprised at how fast you finished it. Keep up the good work",
      "An absolute blast! Very easy to learn the controls, and looks absolutely beautiful. Well done!",
      "peak. really peak.i want more of what is in your storage right now.",
      "Fantastic looking game. \u00a0Love the concept and the whole rolling mechanic. \u00a0Really polished and impressive for a jam. \u00a0This is another winner for sure.",
      "Awesome mechanics! very creative and well implemented :)",
      "Amazing!",
      "Such a fun game! Very cool idea, well executed!",
      "Wow this game is adorable! So much silly fun too, a fantastic casual game that as I'm sure many others have said would work great as a multiplayer game, local or otherwise",
      "This game is just great. The graphics are great, the mechanics are great. We are waiting for a larger version of this game!",
      "This is a crazy jam submission. The level of polish for a 2 week game is unreal. I love katamari so I really enjoyed this game as well. The art looks great, it's fun to play, I really enjoyed this one. Fantastic work I am really impressed.",
      "This would be a great little multiplayer game!",
      "The movement is a little clunky but, other than that, it's a really fun game.",
      "Fun game! It's the first Katamari-type game I've tried. The variety of items you've included shows great potential. I'm excited to see where this goes in the future.",
      "Fun prototype. Was really well polished and was a very chilled experience. Great job!",
      "I am the giant beetle that makes all of the rules. I am the winner of many dung battles. No mere human can fathom the ball I\u00a0am rolling.",
      "Great synergy between the main and second mechanic, love the abilities you gain that help you reach new places. The tutorial is awesome and of course the rest is too. But seriously, I had the most fun in the tutorial, I wouldn't mind having a game about traversing more linear levels with your growing/shrinking ball.",
      "Great game! Really got to look for feedback on this one. Would be nice to see what the enemies got in score making it a bit more suspensefull. Also not sure but you can click the items youve picked? If its the case maybe binding it to u button instead of clicking on it would be smoother with the other controls.Great fun and I love the art!",
      "Fun game! Love that you added AI enemies, it adds a lot to the gameplay. Also, very nice visual style! Good stuff :D",
      "Loved it! Was so fun! Short and polished game! Good job! :"

      "I dont know if It because im tired or some bug god I kept getting rekt lol. Apart from that the game was pretty fun, loved the art, the lore (even basic, who doesn't like a good old arena theme). This could be continued in many ways and would be fun to have many weapon to chose from. AS for the Mechanics they complement well eachother and are a pretty fun. Great game!",
      "Got killed over and over again really quickly. Hard to tell how to kill the mobs without getting hit. But the concept with the two mechanics is pretty good. It was fun.",
      "I couldn't really get far as the amount of enemies increased so rapidly the limited range meant the enemies could practically always hit me. The graphics were simple, but the game probably could've used some audio. I personally couldn't really feel much impact from the cards, but that could be from the dying too early thing, so not going to take any points off from that.",
      "Great concept and design. I got overwhelmed by tons of enemies right from the start. I managed to survive the first wave after many attempts, kinda tough enemies there, but I guess it's also due to my lack of skill at bullet hells \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085. That aside, truly a challenging and cool game! :D",
      "Very challenging, I love the idea of the two mechanics mixed together.",
      "Cool game concept! Not sure I understood what the cards were doing right away but with the tooltip you have in the bottom left along with the descriptions after each wave I was able to piece it together. I would love to see a little more player agency in the card rewards after each wave (instead of getting a random one) but I think you have a great start here",
      "Very nice rogue like with interesting mechanics. I enjoyed playing it. But i think, enemies are a bit hard for the first wave. Hope to see more cards in the future. Well done!",
      "Not a bad game, but it would probably be more comfortable to play with a Numpad (my arrows are broken)\u00a0\u00a0haha, and also maybe I would want the monsters to be weaker at the start and become stronger a bit later",
      "I liked the game! Good job!Only problem was I couldn't understand what the cards did :P",
      "I liked the game! Good job!Only problem was I couldn't understand what the cards did :P",
      "Really cool game. I love the upgrades, I just wish the game was a little easier during the first wave because I almost gave up before I managed to progress with 10 gold. I'm glad I didn't, though, because the later upgrades were worth it!",
      "Fun game )Very cute monster designs!",
      "These little monsters look cool!",
      "Solid game. I hope that this moves forward so that you get a chance to add more abilities and variation to each wave. Good luck!",
      "As a fan bullet heavens,\u00a0I enjoyed this a lot!\u00a0I found the deck building system to go well together with the core gameplay. I managed to only collect like 4 different types of cards, idk how many there is in total but I personally demand\u00a0more. Full release, when?"

For some weird reason the third level maxed out my graphics card and the FPS went to sub 20 which made the level unplayable. Simple graphics and style, but there wasn't much in the\u00a0game\u00a0itself.",

      "Great concept for a game!The mechanics work well together. It did feel a bit empty though..\u00a0Would love to see more levels/areas in future projects!I love the little guy, very cute art :)",
      "The game was fun, but I felt like needing to wait for platforms was a bit unfair.",

      "Neat game with a cute art style. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple and short, but you covered the task well. Good job!",
      "Cool platformer game, love the little bot design.",
      "Very good idea for a game!\u00a0So much tension ))",
      "A good game! I had some trouble getting up the ladder in the surface, but other than that I liked it quite a bit! I would love to see some more levels in the future!",
      "Nice game, when you reach zone 1 you have a very nice feeling of a world opening to you. Please, please add checkpoints. The tension is too much :D. Nice one, man!",
      "haha i imediatly jumped into the first pit before i knew what was going on! Once i got the hang of it it was a fun little core gameplay loop. The mechanics were obvious and well implmeneted creating a tension that built as you progressed. A good ecxample of this is one of the jumpes where you need to go left after the lift but there is a battery pack on the righ too. It a tense split second decision as to whether you should go for more life or risk it in the unknown.",
      "The battery drain definitely adds a level of tension as a mechanic! I found myself rushing to find the next battery right until the end (Thought I was going to lose when I missed that last ladder jump lol) It was fun to play as well, felt good :)Nice job!",
      "Nice little game. I enjoyed playing it. I loved the sounds of the game. Well done!",
      "Exploring is well done with the gimmicks and different areas, lowering battery level also gave a new objective to be as efficient as possible, which was interesting. Would'be fun to figure out what is the ideal route to collect all the batteries without dying.",
      "Cute little game!I happily endorse any game with a cute robot",
      "What a lovely game - I very much enjoyed it and can't wait to see where you take it :) Man that ladder jump... took me a few goes but super cool. Nice one",
      "Really fun game! Love the art style!!",
      "This was a cool platformer. I like the battery mechanic, gives the game a constant sense of urgency. Would've liked to see more content cuz I was enjoying what I played! Great work!",
      "It's creative in that each person is punished for their mistakes at every moment, rather than having a time limit for the entire stage.",
      "game has very nice vibe to it. cool stuff man!",
      "The robot character is very fitting\u00a0with needing to collect batteries. Also traversing the landscape is fun with the moving platforms and ladders. I like that your character has the ability to fall through platforms too and while it works on the moving platforms, I didn't have a need for it so\u00a0would love to see more of this ability if\u00a0you take the game further",
      "Very cool game",
      "Cool idea. \u00a0fun and challenging",
      "Nice little Plattformer :)",
      "That was a fun little game. The jump was a little intense. I think my number one cause of death was smacking my head against the ceiling :D (just like in real life...)",
      "I liked this game. Maybe you could warn somewhere about the continuous draining of the battery, the first time I died I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why. Also, at the end, there is a ladder and a bunch of batteries but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get there. Was I supposed to?",
      "Good job! Short, but sweet",
      "Simple and charming platformer. Collecting batteries before you run out of charge\u00a0reminds me of those underwater levels where you collect air bubbles before running so theres lots to expand upon here :)",
      "Fun and challenging platformer - I wish I didn't have to go back to the beginning every time I ran out of batteries.\u00a0Still this was fun and had a cool look and nice retro sound."

      "The controls were intuitive. Also it felt good dodging the asteroids and\u00a0collecting the goodies, especially when there's\u00a0a big bunch of diamonds together. If you wanted to improve your game some more, I think having\u00a0\u00a0an infinite scrolling area to fly in would be ace",
      "I enjoyed this for far too long as I played it with auto clicker. The amounts of money you can earn right at the start are so large you can get to like level 10000\u00a0in less than 15 minutes. The actual gameplay part was quite limited in scope and had some bugs like collecting after death and being able to die multiple times, menus being on the wrong layer or being disabled etc. just made the game feel a bit cheap.",

      "I liked this game, the loop of collecting treasure and upgrading the jetpack was addicting! It would be nice to know how much each coin / diamond is worth on the higher levels since I think the value increases. The auto click upgrades also got very expensive very fast so I could only buy a few. Would love to see the game developed further!"

      "Really cool game. I liked the vibe of the game a lot and the monster scared me pretty good the first time it showed up. The art looks great and I think the feeding the fire mechanic works really well with trying to balance that and explore to get the fireflies with your torch.\u00a0I found it pretty difficult I think I won on my 4th run by just running around and getting all the fireflies and ignoring the fire completely lol. Great work on this it's super cool!",
      "Wow, great foundation of a game, good atmosphere, creepy monster to avoid, all around fantastic! I\u00a0thought it was pretty tough, then I went back to the main menu and saw there are two harder difficulties?? I can't imagine, but well done regardless",
      "Love the mood and style of this game. The survival is fun and pretty scary. Keeping the fire alive was tough, I think maybe I was over-using torches? Fun game though,\u00a0great job!",
      "Great game! The atmosphere was really good. The enemies felt dangerous and the fire sound effect was a good addition, I'll definitly spread the light :)",
      "The sounds in this game is amazing. You did very well. While at the fire it felt cozy / calm and safe. Outside was terrifying and scary! Well done! :D",
      "Fun little spooky game! Beat it on both easy and normal. Torch ran out every time I went out near the edge of the map to get the flies but the light wand thingies saved me many times. Would be cool to see this develop into a survival farming horror type of game. Good game and well made mechanics. Nice work!",
      "So, when I moved with WASD, I saw that the player walks a bit more seconds than it was supposed to, since you are using Unity, I am guessing you are using the default input system, and used Input.GetKey and now Input.GetKeyRaw, if i'm not mistaken with the names.",
      "I really liked the visual and mechanics of the game)",
      "This is a fun game. Would keep playing if there weren't another 180 games for me to play and rate.",

      "You did an incredibly job with the feel of this game! The mechanics worked very well together and once I figured out you had to HOLD E to gather woods everything felt very intuitive and polished. I'm not much of a fan of horror games but I LOVE this submission, its a wonderful blend of cute and terrifying. I only managed to get 1 firefly but I still had a grand time hoping from light to light. 10/10 would recommend.",

      "Hey! Really nice cartoonish, sketch vibe to your art! I think it's cute! The music choice was fitting. One bit of feedback I have is since the mouse pointer is part of the controls, maybe look into how to replace the mouse cursor with a sprite (like the wizard's hand, or a hand made of magic, etc.) to 1. make it more visible, and 2. make it feel more like you're pushing the enemies away. Good job!",

      "First of all, the art is great, very quirky and charming. After I figured out how to use skills, I feel like they actually brought new game mechanics to the game. My favorite was the shield, at first I just destroyed everything with it but the fact it also destroyed the gems (</3) was game design wise really good decision.

      "Amazing art and fun game. The platforming and instant respawn when you fail a jump feel good. I really like the part where you turn the horizontal bug into a vertical one. Great job.",
      "Very nice adventure game and cute art. Inside the buildings the background tiles could have been more distinct from the floor tiles to make it a bit clearer.",
      "Excellent ! Clear and fun experience. Design is super cute, i want more !!",
      "Very fun and cute game, very cool graphics, nice way of storytelling with all the icons!",
      "I managed to get the flower and its a really good journey and well thought out. I think the\u00a0mechanics are really great and I liked how you can pick up the creatures and throw them. On my first try I accidently trapped myself inside the building and had to restart but other than that it's perfect, definitely a top tier game this round",
      "Beautiful art wraps this very polished platformer featuring a traditional fetch quest. I would had prefer a little faster movement as some areas are a little large (I went left first and had to backtrack). Also, in the vertical bugs section, it was difficult to see the red spikes at the bottom, maybe the camera could shift depending on the area. Great job overall!",
      "Get out of here with your fantastic games and give the rest of us a chance! \u00f0\u009f\u0098",
      "Very beautiful game that was very well done. This is one of my favorites from this round. Good work, no notes.",
      "What an adorably lovely game. I loved every second of playing this, so sweet and wholesome, and the puzzles were simple and easy to understand but still fun to complete. No notes, this was fantastic",
      "And there is more and more and mooore! This is a complete mini game. I couldn't believe how many mechanics there were and the progression with getting closer to growing the flower just felt amazing! One of my favorite entries.",
      "really fun but i couldnt finish it cause i accidentally softlocked myself here :L",
      "I was addicted and completely zoned in, I\u00a0needed to complete it! Amazing art, and music, and the progression...just five stars across the board.",
      "Games like this really inspire me! There's a crazy level of polish on this for a 2 week game jam. The music, mechanics, and art style all blend in super nicely. The level design was really good. I like the order in which certain times/mechanics were introduced, and the hint system was great.",
      "Very cute little game!\u00a0Pure fun )",
      "The amount of art and content impresses me, I don't actually remember if I've seen a Construct game this well made before. Also, I love the little bugs walking around the map. Good work!",
      "This was very well done! Played through the whole game and enjoyed every bit of it! :D",
      "I thought this game was great! I like that you can pick up like anything on the map lol. I think I may have accidentally skipped a big portion of the game by stacking all of the rocks on top of each other to directly get to the cat ladies house... but that just shows amazing amounts of player freedom! (please do not hate me for accidentally creating speed-running tech) Anyways, good job on the game!",
      "Finally managed to get that darn flower!Great use of tips and love the overall look and feel. Good laid back game.",
      "cute and fun game. love the main character.",
      "Adorable, complete, and fun! The platforming didn't always feel the smoothest, particularly the jump between the left side of the map and the cat lady house felt a little too far to be comfortable with the provided mushroom on the closest tile. I loved the little puzzles, though; realizing I could pick up the mushrooms and the bugs was particularly satisfying.",
      "This game has a clean and shiny quality to it that i really like. I like the character sprites a lot. Nice work on the object-trade puzzle aspect. Very creative!",
      "The polish and level design here is great!\u00a0 Excellent job as expected",
      "The artwork is next level.\u00a0 Music fits well.\u00a0 Sound effects would be a welcome addition, if you continue this game.",
      "I really dig the art, and the quests were creative. For some reason I had a hard time pressing space, kept pressing x instead, I would've appreciated the ability to jump with up arrow instead. Went into the cave first but then after a bit I managed to lock myself in in the hay house...",
      "Fantastic game! \u00a0Beautiful graphics with really fun animation.\u00a0\u00a0Easy mechanics and clever puzzles.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely one of my favorites. \u00a0So impressed with how much you were able to create during the jam.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you get to continue this!",
      "Saw this on someone's \"goated\" list and yup this is definitely top 3 and I don't even what other two games would be. Best cartoony game I played in a while.",
      "This game is great. I love the art style and overall it's very polished for a jam entry! I think my only complaint is that it was a bit easy, but that's kind of a personal preference thing. Great work on this it's one of my favs from the jam!"

      "I like finding and getting the foxes to follow back, I think the game could be expanded on. Great work! Also, I liked the art style in this, it fits the game.",
      "I had a good time playing but I would suggest making a web build or looking a bit in the optimizition part because a lot will just ignore it due to file size and you'll be missing votes even tho the game is great",
      "A very fun little game. In some ways it reminds me of trying to get my dog back when she is off leash at the dog park. :)",
      "loved it!very well align with the task both core and secondary really fits wellnice work man!you know that blue ice platform yeah i kinda left the fox there and it diedmy bad..",

      "Cool concept! I wish things were just a bit quicker, but fun.",
      "I think the game does a great job in setting the mood, from the initial cutscene, to the igloo, to all the effects (water, snow and so on). I think it has a lot of potential for future expansion (loved the hexagonal tiles!)",
      "3D art is the game's strongest point, especially those funky looking foxes. Not sure what the \u00a0mechanics are tho since they are not stated on the jam page. Collect foxes /\u00a0hit the blocks maybe?"

      "Such a nice duality between the two worlds! I probably spend so much time playing this (checking my last comment was 30 mins ago...\u00a0) the music, the pacing, the SFX. Instead of making 2 mechanics you made two games!Stayed till the end to beat the boss. Congratulations on such a cool experience!",
      "This game was so fun and addictive! I would love to see you expand on the game.",
      "Amazing! Excelent gameplay loop!My only complaint is that the bullets feel \"attached\" to the player, as the bullets follows the player movement.are the bullets spawned as children of the ship?",
      "Really felt like there could've been a range and a magnet ability for gems. Overall the farming felt a bit weaker compared to the main game where all of the progression was felt. The graphic styles were nice but a bit different from each other which looked a bit weird to my eye.",
      "Task: mechanics that complement each othernickbdawg: \"what if I\u00a0made two full games that complement each other?\"",
      "Very interesting genre mash-up! Never seen anything like this!",
      "The mixed game modes worked really well. I had fun in both and can see a lot of potential in both areas. Really fun game.",
      "Fun game! I love the creative mechanics combinations. They work pretty well together. I feel that adding an attack range upgrade would be great for this game. Great job!\"",
      "a really well\u00a0executed game for theme wise, tho there are lot of things to improve ,one of which are the controls.never mind the graphics and the audio it's not important, I think this is a well put together submission and would love to see this on 2nd round. job well done \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aa",
      "Wow that was surprisingly addicting, my economy started\u00a0to ramp up really fast once I got that third flower into my farm and it was fun to see how fast I started killing enemies once I\u00a0got that going! One small thing I noticed (and I'm not sure if this was intentional or not) but the bullets I fired seemed to move with my character as I moved around instead of keeping their own trajectory in space.",
      "I felt so weak at the beginning and now little space enemies fear me (thanks to\u00a0my amazing flower farm)!! Its a lot like stardew valley but space/bullet hell.",
      "that was really good,\u00a0 the two game genres complement each others\u00a0and \u00a0the sensation of power in the end is great .",
      "It's quite a nice game loop.\u00a0 It was a game I wanted to keep playing.\u00a0\u00a0The frenetic space combat works well when juxtaposed with relaxing farming.\u00a0 I could easily see this as a popular experience, if polished and developed enough.\u00a0 Definitely a great start.\u00a0 Good luck!",
      "Awesome game!!",
      "It's a very exciting game. I liked the moments of fighting with aliens and the moments of peaceful gardening",
      "This game and its upgrading systems are actually fun, if this was a (reasonably priced) Steam game I would 100%\u00a0buy it.\u00a0I was having almost too much fun and spent a great amount of time playing the game. If you were ever up to updating it, I would maybe reconsider adding pick range and range updates at some point. But those were literally the only things I was missing, oh and I need\u00a0more levels of course.",
      "Awesome!",
      "Real fun game and also one that kept me playing, only thing Id would change is the boss timer or make it an upgrade. I get that its for the end of the game but in a gamejam a lot of people will try and move on and it would be sad people miss out on that.Great job and curious to what youll do with it :)",
      "this one sticks out to me :) i had a pleasant experience. was confused when i got thrown into battle, but was able to figure it out.\u00a0i love how far outside of the box you strayed to come up with a primary mechanic of cozy gardening and a secondary mechanic of deadly space battle and somehow they complement each other so well. that right there is a beautiful blend of creativity and capability. i hope you had fun making it :)",
      "I love everything about this. Good job!",
      "I loved the crazy idea of combining a farming sim with bullet hell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the unexpected pairing worked surprisingly well.\u00a0 The initial feeling of powerlessness transitioning to unstoppable space farmer was incredibly satisfying.\u00a0 However, I did notice the bullets felt a bit 'sticky' to the ship.Still, the overall concept is brilliant and genuinely innovative.. Fantastic work!",
      "You have so\u00a0much packed into this game. \u00a0I was having fun shooting things and then suddenly it's like there is a whole other game going on back on the planet.\u00a0 I'm not usually a huge fan of\u00a0farming type games, but this was impressive.",
      "Fun feedback loop! The two activities complemented each other very well. I would have liked to see the total number of gems collected while still in the spaceship (number go up, feels good). Like others have mentioned the bullets being parented to the player is a bit strange/overpowered, and the WASD + Arrow keys controls are a bit awkward.",
      "The 2 genres work quite well together. The only thing i have to note is, that in the bullet hell mode, the bullets seem to be moving with the player / enemies. This was quite weird at first.The farming was suprisingly strategic, that's a nice touch.",
      "I have to admit that bullet hell + farming simulator was not a combo I expected haha.\u00a0 It was a lot of fun though!\u00a0 Really solid job on this and impressive that your mechanics were so different.",
      "I managed to defeat the boss, he was actually easier than I\u00a0thought he would be but still pretty cool. Having the farming and the space battles is a great idea and there's definitely a lot of choices in the game which lead to progression. The space battle section is my favourite side of things and I liked that the ship had a magnetic field for drawing in the crystals",
      "Very fun game! I killed the boss :D",
      "i liked it, it was a bullet hell, then turned to a FARMING GAME!\u00a0hilarious, great game!",
      "I love the concept of this game. The space portion was like a more fast-paced, action-packed version of the mines in Stardew Valley. If asteroids, space stations, other ships were added to the space portions, this game could be a truly great \"farm sim with spaceships\".\u00a0While your two dueling mechanics seem at odds, I think they pair together quite well. This is aided by the fact that you made farming more fast-paced and generous than in other farming sims (which is also great for a jam game).A very ambitious and exciting entry!",

      "This was actually a pretty cool \"proof of concept\". \u00a0I love the 3d nature of it and the problem solving. \u00a0Sometimes the camera angles were a little funky, but that is a small complaint. \u00a0I do hope you get to continue this.",

      "Fun but short game. And I appreciate it, I still have 123 more games to play. Great concept with a lot of room to grow.",
      "Short and sweet! I can envision some good puzzles with this one if developed further",
      "The mechanics all were well thought out. \u00a0All made sense pretty much immediately.\u00a0 Occasionally, I'd get stuck on walls with the jump.\u00a0 Possibly a material friction? \u00a0But that's \u00a0a fairly small aside. \u00a0Love that you included the controls on the ground. \u00a0Made it super intuitive to figure out. \u00a0Nice job!",
      "The game was fun! I just had a bit of struggle with the camera angles. Rest good POC. Would like to see it develop further.",
      "Good base to build upon with a variety of interactive objects. I'd be interested in seeing some levels and puzzle made with these existing interaction objects"

      "There is some idea here, but currently it is very limited. No idea why the window is so damn small, I couldn't even read what the signs were trying to tell.Backtracking was a bit of an odd choice, but that wasn't the worst thing honestly.",
      "Very, very innovative.",
      "Very fun to play! The different arrow types were awesome to use and the controls felt nice. Great entry!",
      "Such an awesome concept! Loved it! YOU SHOULD DEF EXPAND ON THIS! :D",
      "The mechanics are really neat so far. I haven't seen a platformer quite like this yet. I love that you even added a different kind of spear that isn't used as a platform but to freeze the poison lake. You've already captured my imagination on how this game could go... Great game!",
      "I love the art and sliding, was having a little trouble figuring out how to fire my weapon..",
      "Cool game! I always love the idea of platforming being something that the player has a lot of control over and with your spear mechanic that is definitely accomplished. I cant wait to see how you develop this further!",
      "it's great , from what i played , you almost have an infinity of possibilities with those spears as you can add the effect you want if you continue to develop this game . The tutorial you made\u00a0 is simple and easy to understand , i'm taking notes .",
      "Really great entry, loved this game! The spear mechanics added a fun level of exploration and progression.",
      "Really solid entry, I loved the animations and the spear platforming. Controls were tight, I hope to see the game developed upon further!",

      "Using the spears to move through the level is a clever take on the rounds task. Cool concept!"

      "Such a cool concept. I do think the camera should switch between the players. Also some type of indication that tells you which player is currently selected. Another thing is that the platforming was a bit hard, the movement was linear so doing small tweaks wasn't possible. I think lowering the movementspeed and adding\u00a0some acceraltion to the movement would be an good idea, so that you can make those small adjustments.",
      "Character switching was a really clever idea!\u00a0 As others have mentioned there are some things with the mechanic that could have been a little smoother such as switching camera, making it clear which character was selected, etc.., but overall I'm really interested to see where you take it!",
      "Really cool mechanics and a fun game. I sometimes got confused with which button to press to change characters and ended up in a pit as a result so I\u00a0think if it was one button instead of 2 to switch characters it would make it a little easier. I'm sure my speedrun will be amongst the slowest but I'll share it for anyone that wants to beat my time",
      "Interesting idea. I would have liked to see a more complementary use of the 2 characters. The player has to do it at the beginning. But later when it comes to tight platforming its not important anymore. It felt like I had to do a section 2 times instead of 1 time. In addition the hitboxes of mines were a bit to strict for my taste.",
      "I really liked the switching mechanics and the camera only following one of the characters added to the platform puzzles. Had a lot of, well done!",
      "Very interesting idea !",
      "It was hard. and fun! and hard. I liked the switching mechanic!",
      "I know this is a skill issue in thelargestdegree, but it was hard. Graphics were simple, but it worked well with the boxy nature of the levels. Simple fast paced gameplay, the respawning mechanic was a bit buggy with trails appearing after respawning and the characters clipping into each other.",
      "I agree with the previous comment, I just assume that the first mechanic is switch and second is platforming. But a nice little platformer, you should add a masochist mode without any checkpoints.",
      "cool game. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of hard to guess the primary and secondary mechanic with no description but I think the box is primary and rectangle is secondary mechanic. overall game is engaging and nice."

      "The mechanics are really good. The story and art make me want to see more of this game. Well done.",

      "I'm fully upvoting you in the hopes of you feeding my gambling addiction in round 2. Please give us a roulette table!",

      "I don't have a gambling issue, I don't have a gambling issue!!! I really enjoyed planting the coins and going to the slots!!",
      "This game is criminally underrated! great job! I\u00a0want to see more of your work",
      "I like the concept, but the game itself wasn't very engaging. I think that could be fixed by giving the player stuff to do while they wait for the crops to grow. Also, the music felt too high pitched and ear piercing to me, but that could be my headphones.",
      "I really wanted to play this game, but it crashed every time a flower was on screen. I'm also not sure if every texture was meant to flicker black, but it added a nice feel to the game. Like it was haunted. I'll try to play again later!",
      "Hey, good to see you made it! And it was awesome to finally get to play the finished version of what I watched being developed, a whole new dimension. I\u00a0think you did great with setting, graphics, and controls,it felt like a real place and a unique\u00a0world of its own. The economy is a bit off (to the player's advantage) and gameplay maybe not super fun (as expected when rushing a farming game) but it's bug-free and works as intended so yay I think you should be proud."

Movement felt a bit weird as it felt like sideways movement was coated in honey with a delay but vertical movement didn't have any of that. The upgrades sometimes didn't hit even after figuring out you could reach a cap on them. Also no clue how the boss is supposed to be killed as he just kept floating around for a long time.",

      "From the title and thumbnail I expected the digging mechanic to be like \"the\" main thing and everything revolving around that, but in reality it was a walking sim with a shovel as melee to dig. The lack of checkpoints was a bit of a shocker as now only two games haven't had that and in my opinion this could've used that. The graphics were nice, but this isn't an art contest currently.",

It seems like there's no point to do anything besides grow peppers cuz they're cheapest and everything gave 15 coins when I sold it. Would love to see this expanded upon it's a great start!",

You did a great job of bringing the assets to life, making the first person control work really well for a farming game, etc. Nice work!",

      "Good foundation, I can see a lot of potential for a great farming sim here! As others have said the movement felt very crisp and good, though I think the farming loop could be elaborated on a little bit (maybe some additional steps in there, like having to water the crops, or fertilize, or both) but you may be planning that already. Either way, I look forward to seeing how this develops!",

      "I sold all my furniture for 10 money to become a farmer and it payed off. It was enjoyable for a while, my only complaint is it seems some more expensive seeds grow into plants that give the same amount of money as corn (15), with bell peppers turning out to be most profitable, or am I missing something.",

I also spent a little time figuring out where I could plant seeds\u2014it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit confusing to have tomato plants you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t harvest. But overall, very good job!"

      "Absolute Cinema \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009a\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ae\u00e2\u009c\u008b",
      "AMAZING",
      "Wow fun game! Gameplay felt smooth, and the progression felt good - damage bumps were very noticeable as I\u00a0got upgrades. It was a little confusing at first that hitting enemies was taking away from my health bar, but I was able to get the hang of it before long. The only issue I really ran into was the game slowing down as I\u00a0got more upgrades - it seemed to freeze for a second or two when I was hitting enemies after I had a handful of upgrades.",
      "Looking forward to playing this once its finished! Wow amazing art and idea! :D",
      "This is neat! I really liked that every time you do an attack it is a different attack from the last. It was a good twist on the autoshooter arena battler genre. I had a small problem where enemies would get stuck on the little rocks lol, but other than that little hiccup the game worked very well for me and was a good bit of fun!",
      "This is impressive given the timeline and fun to play. Gave me Nodebuster meets Vampire Survivor vibes.",
      "Wow! \u00a0Your skill tree is insane - so cool. \u00a0Personally, I was terrible at the combat, but I was still blown away by how much you got into your game in two weeks.\u00a0 \u00a0As another Construct 3 developer I am very impressed.",
      "That was fun :) I think the only criticism I\u00a0could give would be the purple rocks purple floor combo :P I got stuck on a rock more than a few times because I\u00a0didn't see it.",
      "There was a lot in this with the upgrade system and the battles.\u00a0 The art and style all looked great! There was a good feeling of progression by buying the upgrades and going back into the battles a little stronger. Great game, I'd like to see this taken a lot farther.",
      "Absolutely insane to have been done solo in 2 weeks! Amazing! The skill tree is a lot to look at, I'd love for it to get visually clearer, and the level selection feels odd, especially before you unlock a second level. I'd also love to be able to choose what to cast and when, to really make the most of the 'core' provided and perhaps be able to get further sooner by risking bunching up more enemies before I shoot.\u00a0 All in all, very fun, I love the elements and the visual polish, great game."

      "The mechanics worked well together, this was a fun game! Would love to play more levels of this if you choose to keep developing it!",

Currently it's rather easy. Just that the player has to put in more thought when to pick up the sword. When to kill enemies and more. Currently I pick it up. Slash a bit. Place it down further from the enemies.Maybe in combination with bullet hell mechanics? Or some other mechanics that change the area. This way the player has to plan their swings more careful.Great game!",

      "In my top 3 entries here (and I've played about 150 so far), the idea just feels so special and has a lot of potential in my opinion. I felt that kind of childish joy when encountering something really new and creative for the first time. I wished it was a slightly faster tho\u00a0and obviously that it would have more content in the future. The game actually kind of reminds me of scribblenauts! What a wonderful experience.",
      "Typing out the spell and modifiers made casting spells pretty fun. I like the mechanics and can see a lot of fun places you can go from what you have here. Well done!",

      "WOW! IT was very cool once you figured it out!",
      "Interesting variation of typing games.\u00a0 I'd suggest using simple words to begin with like \"heal\" and \"strike\".\u00a0 Those could be used for initial waves.\u00a0 Then let the player add words for stronger attacks, in successive waves,\u00a0like \"medicine\", \"rejuvenate\", etc.\u00a0 That would give a good sense of progression.",
      "After i type out a spell, it is taking a long time for it to come to effect?\u00a0The timer can be reduced, otherwise a game with great concept. But I am too impatient lol.",
      "After reading your instructions, the game was really fun to play. I very much enjoyed the typing out attacks with adjectives. I feel like this game could potentially be really helpful for teaching typing. I was even imagining further in the game adding numbers to increase attack powers or do multiple attacks, like \"sword slash x3\" to do a triple attack or something, and even\u00a0unlocking \"runes\" that are symbols\u00a0like[ %, _, @, ;, . (, )] to help train typing of\u00a0those more difficult symbols. Lots of potential, but yes nice work and very creative.",
      "i really like the idea but i dont see how to progress in this game so far because at some point you will just die so\u00a0there would need to be some upgrades or so aswell or more words that you can unlock besides that i think it is really cool that you can use the effects on any spell",

The way all of the herons moved towards me didn't feel quite right, like if there's something missing but I can't fully put my finger on it. I did manage to beat it on my third try, cool game! We certainly have some similarities between our submissions :D",

While it is challenging to get your jumps right at the beginning, as the game goes on you eventually get the hang of it, and that is satisfying.

      "i fed so many frogs to these Herons! I did feel an improvement after the 20th time but still I agree, it does feel a bit too hard. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact Herons attack when you make a noise, its great! But perhaps lowering their hearing area and/or attack area.",
      "Interesting gameplay, but it seemed a bit difficult to me. Change the style of the game a little and it will be possible to make a horror. Do not abandon the development of this project after Jam\u00a0;)",
      "I really like the vibe and look of this game. The game is also well-designed, though difficult! When the herons were onto me it felt exactly like running from the cops\u00a0in GTA. VERY nice work!",
      "This is great game. It took me while to figure out how to start game. It would be great multiplier game for two like tricking storks or if someone messed up the other one will be croak to save situation which will put him in danger.",
      "I am terrible at this game, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. \u00a0Love the animations and sounds.\u00a0\u00a0I wish it was a little easier at the beginning - those herons got me every time.\u00a0 Still, this was fun, while I lasted.",
      "At first, I\u00a0didn't fully get the concept and the alignment to the task... But once I knew (by reading the comments/description) that enemies are attracted to the croak position, that's perfect. Really awesome concept! ___ Two suggestions: making these rules/goal clearer ingame and\u00a0make the game a little bit easier (by reducing the enemy range and making the frog get back quicker to a jumpable position). Very well done!",
      "Welcome in Discovery Channel! Beautiful graphics and interesting mechanics. I enjoyed the jumping and that frog finds the leaf even you missed a jump. Maybe those birds could be a bit slower, because it got very tense after croaking.",
      "What a nice little frogg... BIRDS! BIRDS! WAAHHHGHGHGH!",
      "Those enemies are brutal :D one mistake and you get swarmed lol. Took me a few minutes and lots of deaths but finally managed to find a frogger friend. Overall pretty fun game, good job!",
      "Love this game. Nailing the jumps is very rewarding!",
      "The concept is nice. I wish I could jump quicker when the enemies are close because I need to click first and then click again, maybe aim with mouse and charge jump wit a button.",
      "This was fun! It's really cute and surprisingly hard. I was able to get to the other frog by just doing max jumps constantly towards it while running away from the herons lol. I tried playing it I think the correct way for a bit, but I got caught by the birds so fast each time. Great work on this!",
      "this is such a cute simple concept! This needs to be expanded more"

      "The player movement ist fantastic. I think the lasers got out of sync, because I took to long in some levels, but im not sure. Definitely not an easy game, but a great skillcurve. The mechanics are presented slowly one after the other. Good Job!",
      "your game made me sweat ,\u00a0 add a chrono and i'm sure many people in the jam will start speedrunning it\u00a0. there is also a good gamefeel when it comes to make the\u00a0character\u00a0 jump . i'll take inspiration from your game to get better",
      "Very cool looking game! Loved levels 6 and 7 )",
      "I really enjoyed this game. The art style and music give the game such a great vibe. I like the ramp up in difficulty, the last few levels definitely get challenging. I really enjoyed that the gameplay was more focused on execution rather than puzzles since I'm bad at puzzles, but I\u00a0guess that's just a personal preference kinda thing. Great job on this it is so cool!",
      "I made it to level 9. You really didn't pull any punches, man this game is HARD.",
      "Okay, you can take your freakin lazers and just walk to round 3! This is such a rage inducing game but I can't stop playing it! Not sure if you are aware, on level 4 it was taking me so long to complete that the music stopped playing. You know like at a party when they turn the lights on saying hey get out of here already! haha",
      "1. I'm loving the neon retro art (show me how you did it plzplz, especially how you got the colours around the edges. did you just paint the whole thing and import it as a single sprite?)",
      "Simple yet effectively fun platformer! Loved playing through it, and your level design was fantastic! That last level especially oh man, that one was tough",
      "Really well made, great work",
      "A neat neon platformer! I had a little trouble getting the timing right on some of the jumps (I fear I make a bad coyote) but had a good time with the game overall! I can't wait to see how you develop this further!",
      "This was incredibly addicting. it had the right amount of progressive difficulty. \u00a0 I really enjoyed it",
      "This is peak! I could learn so much from this.. You made your mechanics so well and it was very easy to pick up and play. It was fun and tricky, but not to overwhealming. Looking forward to your progress! :D",
      "",
      "I ragequitted on the 4 level i thinkBut i liked it",
      "love it brainfart! dont really know what the secondary mechanic is, but i love the smooth movement and the lasers!",
      "The colors and particle effect was fun! The platforming too! Struggled with laser timings but that is a gamer skill issue lol.",
      "Oooh really tough but thrilling game! The mechanics work like a dream.Not a big point, but I love the colors of the walls.",
      "Cool platformer, lasers felt annoying in some levels but overall its good and engaging.",
      "Great platformer, love the mechanics and the art design. The game feels a little bit hard. The jump timing, the windows between laser beams, and the time you have after deactivating lasers all feel very tight. But overall, very good game.",
      "Great platformer! And epic music to accompany :)",
      "Great level design and fun (and a little rage inducing) to play. Made it through til the end.  I liked how far you could jump if you held space, it made for some cool level design that wouldn't been possible otherwise, and since you have the variable jump it didn't feel floaty. Three things I wished improved was:1. Make the respawn a bit quicker2. A little flash or something to let you know that the laser is turning on again (like 0.5s before it starts killing you)3. Make it so if you are standing still on a button the laser doesn't reactivate (currently you have to exit and reenter it for it to not start again, which is completely understandable from a programming perspective, but it felt illogical in game)",
      "It was tough, but enjoyable. I felt like the character moved master horizontally than vertically, which was unique",
      "Good job on aesthetics, learning curve, and game in general. The final level was satisfyingly hard. One remark is, since up key isn't used you could have used it for jump.",
      "That was fun :)",
      "Love the ambience of this game! I'm not great\u00a0at platformers, but I kept playing for as long as I could to try beat it! Didn't get very far, but still enjoyed it! Really amazing entry!",
      "Nice platformer! The minimalist art is quite stylish with the colors and the bloom. I managed to get to level 11 (out of 12?). On that note it might be nice to number the levels, if it's an arcade-style game. Also the menu font could be made more easily readable.",
      "Finally got around to your game. The mechanics are spot on and fit the prompt and knocked it out in the judging criteria. A good set of puzzle levels to work through. Could see this expanded with more level items. Awesome game!",
      "I managed to complete all of the levels and it's great that you made so many and they are all really well designed. I\u00a0like that it automatically saves the progress that you made too and that you can choose to revisit previous ones.\u00a0 Also your\u00a0moving lasers are awesome! Not sure if anyone has mentioned it or not\u00a0but I did notice the music stopped looping",
      "Very fun, difficult, and amazing visuals! There were some times where the jumping felta littleoff, but other than that I\u00a0have no complaints!",
      "Super super fun and stylistic game. Hyper-focused mechanics and levels designed with solely those mechanics in mind. Visuals and colors are both pleasing and efficient. Killer music and atmosphere. And most importantly to me, a fun and challenging game. Well done!!!",
      "Easily one of the most polished games I've played so far and one of my favorites as well too.\u00a0\u00a0Great looking, great sounding, and challenging, but not impossible.\u00a0\u00a0This one's a winner.",
      "Amazing game! Loved the tricky puzzles. It felt like I was fighting with the lasers a lot of the time, but that's the fun of the game. I would love to see this continued.",
      "I'll be honest, I would have preferred a full jump instead of a variable jump. I felt like I\u00a0was fighting it the whole time. Otherwise, this was a great game! Challenging platformer.",
      "Gameplay was really intense. I never seen such mechanics, but i really enjoyed playing it. Very unique style of level design and use of movement. Really good game. One of my favourites!",
      "This game made me break my monitor",
      "Wow. Just... wow. This game has changed my life. I laughed, I cried, I transcended. My cat even started playing, and now she's better than me. 11/10, would play again forever. Critics are calling it 'the Citizen Kane of rage inducing platformer\u00a0games.' A true masterpiece that has set the bar for all future games. Bravo, me. Bravo. \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00a4\u00e2\u009c\u00a8",
      "A simple and understandable game in a good sense, good work",
      "Very cool game!Rage inducing difficulty of the levels kept me wanting to complete it.The retro art looks nice and the music has a good beat, with a\u00a0sense of urgency; both compliment the style of game well.Overall the mechanics align with the Jam Task well.Great job!",
      "The levels are mostly well paced and provide a good sense of progression. Jumping feels a little too floaty but that doesn't hurt the movement too much. The player seems to stick to walls and ceilings, that did get on my nerves a little bit.",
      "Neat little game, I will leave more feedback for you on Discord. Great job."

      "A very solid and well-made shooter using Unreal. Quite impressive, everything is there. I wish there was a bit more of a hook to the gameplay, but it's a fantastic prototype for the time allotted. Sorry I didn't get to this one before the voting deadline!",
      "Reminded me a lot of laser tag. The mechanics are there and the game is fun. I\u00a0think the game has a lot of potential.",
      "Straight of the bat this did a great job at taking me back to 'Zapzone' and other laser tag places from my childhook. The map, layout, scoreboards etc were all spot on for creating that atmosphere.The enemies and the world gave a interesting fututristic impression that made me interested in the world. There was definitly a forboding atmosphere to it all and it felt very dystopian. I would like to see a little more variety in the enviroment if you carry this on. I think the layout was great but maybe some environmental hints at the story/world building?",

I would've really liked an upgrade tree or something to spice things up after progressing thru the waves. Great job on this!",

      "Interesting idea :) It could use a little polish but I\u00a0could see this growing into something pretty cool.",
      "First impressions were quite bad as the game was laggy as all hell (first one for this jam) and the block placing and collecting mechanic was unclear and a bit buggy (not placing and the sorts). The lag persisted through out the game but then there were also hard freezes for some time which made the platforming extremely annoying from losing progress from something beyond my control.",

      "This is a really cool idea and you did a good job implementing it. I had a lot of fun playing!On level 2, my browser crashed. It looks like something in your code is probably causing a memory leak, the framerate steadily dropped until it froze then crashed. ( for example,\u00a0maybe something is creating objects over and over, etc. )Overall a really fun and expandable idea.\u00a0Being able to grab a platform and take it with me was fun.",

      "I love these kind of games. \u00a0I think you have the beginnings of a good, but rough prototype here. \u00a0I hope you get a chance to expand upon it further.",
      "Very cool idea for a game! I love factorio and seeing the conveyor belts instantly made me happy. I like the shooting section it feels good and it's fun to kill the dudes. I think I needed more tutorials on how to craft stuff, I got my smelter to make iron bars, but I was trying to turn that into 3 iron rods that the belts need and I wasn't able to figure out how to get it to work. Really impressive work for 2 weeks tho, making a factory game and a wave based shooter in that time is crazy. Great work!",
      "this is a really cool idea. i had a difficult time onboarding and still feel like there are features i'm being ignorant of. the work you put into this is clear right off the bat, well done. i hope you had fun making it :)",
      "Really like this game! Can't wait to see what you do next with it! As others suggested I'd focus on reworking the UI layout, maybe add a few more tutorials to help the player understand what to do. It took me a second to understand the gameplay but when I did it was very fun and built my resources :D . Also maybe have the enemies paused while you are building and when you come back have them\u00a0\u00a0start a few seconds later. Every time I came back to that world they just swarmed me.",
      "It seems like a very cool idea, and once this gets some polishing I would love to try it!",
      "This was fun to play! I was a bit confused of what to do at first, but then eventually got the hang of it! Nice work!",
      "I was a bit confused, but I still enjoyed the game a lot!",
      "I really like the concept of having like a resource gathering and management game with an action shooter. I think you covered the task well and think you could take this game forward in many different great ways.",
      "Ah!\u00a0\u00a0VS style game.\u00a0\u00a0Nice!\u00a0 Movement controller and shooting both felt nice.\u00a0 Had no issues with either.\u00a0 During the second phase, I couldn't quite figure out what I was supposed to be doing for a while.\u00a0 Maybe some UI panels to explain some of the different buildings?\u00a0 I think you're onto something with that two-phase style gameplay.\u00a0 Keep going with that.\u00a0 Cheers!"

I like the mechanic of dodging stuff a lot, kinda reminds me of undertale. I also appreciated the variety of patterns you had to dodge to keep things fresh. Great work on this I had fun playing thru it!",

      "First of all, I really liked the style of the game. The drawing is just wow. secondly, I was very fascinated by the mechanics of the game. Everything was done superbly)",
      "Loved playing the mini games. It would be great if there was a little more feedback on my actions, it was hard to tell if I was doing good or not or failed. Reading your comment here helps a ton with understanding everything. I'd really like to see you take this concept further.",
      "This was fun!The core + secondary mechanic played nicely together! Making the amount of healing done a function of the amount dodged keeps the game very active. I also really like the DnD theme. I would really like to see this one make it to the next round!",
      "So first of all i really like the idea of this game. I'm also a big fan of turnbased games especially when you then have to play these mini games so thats really well done i also like that those depend on what heal you are choosing.",
      "Took me a few tries to get the hang of it but once I understood the different phases it made perfect sense. Really interesting concept, just specifically playing the healer and trying to keep the rest of your party alive but not having control over the actual party. The mechanics are interesting, and I can see a lot of potential for progression and extending this!",

      "Unintentionally the most fun game thus far, decided for no reason to do a 0 orb speedrun which took in total 20 minutes of spamming Q so hard I had to take breaks. First level was for sure the hardest while the two others were a breeze after that. Maybe not the most unique in mechanics but entertaining regardless!"

      "Interesting take on the side scroller jumper genre but the the lack of checkpoints really killed all interest for me. I don't know how far I got but falling and resetting to the start was annoying because the game is quite slow. The graphic were simple and didn't really seem to be the selling point of this game anyways.",

      "hi nice game feels comlised but the only thing i didnt liked was that the jump was realy slow like in slow-motion",
      "I wasn't sure how it worked at the beginning, once I understood that your light mode could double jump and you had to unlock the dark mode in the level I got the hang of it. Very cool mechanic, once I understood it!",
      "Solid mechanic, I\u00a0like how the game uses the mechanic\u00a0to switch between light and dark for the challenging jumps. If you made the contrast between the dark tiles and the background a bit better it would be easier to plan out jumps and a lot harder to get caught off guard when you're in light mode"

Implemented the use of switching the reflectors and riding the light really well.The puzzles were the perfect balance of difficult and interesting to keep me captivated.The eerie tone of the music gives you an uneasy feeling, but in a \"I'm stuck in a never-ending labyrinth\" sort of way.

      "I liked this game a lot. I love how quick and easy it is to understand the game. Also, great job on all the upgrades/abilities! Very fun stuff",
      "Really cool idea for a platformer and speedrun game! My best time ended up being 7.59. All the mechanics feel really great and there are a lot of them too which is impressive. I would've liked maybe some more levels to really get to utilize the mechanics after unlocking them, but not a huge deal or anything. Great work on this!",
      "This was a super fun game. I love how youve taken the idea of a speedrun game and added the abilities to get it done faster. One thing I would suggest though, is that i unlocked more than half of the abilities after the first run so you could probably make it a bit harder to get the abilities. I would love to see this game get worked and improved apon with more levels and abilities. Amazing work!",
      "Asking for a speed run is a clever way to increase playtime :) It could be little bit bigger map to see the effect of upgrades but good job at all!",
      "I love the art and all the mechanics were very well done. I think a harder level would have made the game more engaging since players would have slow starting scores and the various additional abilities would be more able to boost their speeds.",
      "Really interesting concept, i think the level is a bit too short as i was able to get a pretty fast score on my first try so the upgrades werent super useful, otherwise great\u00a0job!",
      "I think you could do some cool things with this. I already had a pretty good score the first time around. I think you could push the speedrun part even further, for example at the start make it almost impossible to beat the game in a short amount of time. For example you can give the player the speed of a turtle initially or\u00a0you need to take a longer route because your jump is not high enough yet, that would be an easy way to extend the gameplay and could even be funny.",
      "Cute game and quite addictive - nice one! The movement is super smooth and I love the secondary mechanic of adding new abilities.",
      "WR? lol. This is a great game! Can't wait to see this in round 2",
      "Very very good idea\u00a0 !",
      "This is one very good concept which I\u00a0would love to see get more worked on. WELL DONE :D",
      "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a whole metroidvania in one small level :) The mental progression of mechanics is excellently traced - mastering the abilities the character already has, and by overcoming each time threshold, we gain new abilities that we can also learn to use and complete the level even faster.",
      "This game is actually wicked! YOU ADDED A GRAPPLE HOOK! The movement, the different cards, the unlocking system, the core gameplay loop. I love absolutely everything about this game!",
      "Super fun! My little goldfish-brain attention span stayed engaged!",
      "Really liked this game, was fun trying out all the abilities to try to get a faster time. Well done!",
      "Quite an interesting premise.\u00a0 Very fun to play.\u00a0\u00a0The platforming is really well done and feels great, which is more difficult to accomplish than it might seem.\u00a0 I can see a lot of interest in this type of game.",
      "Dude, the movements were perfect! I only found a bit slippery the walking, but dude, you are going to win this!",
      "GOSH this game is CUTE and COOLEverything you need in a game jam gameI wanna see this concept expanded to have different and limited abilities to mix and match. Could have a lot of depth and meta discussion around best builds and speedruns!",
      "9 seconds . best game ever.",
      "I really like the idea and the art of this game."

      "Very confusing controls and gameplay. Not sure if a tutorial would've helped either as even the objective was quite unclear. Also not sure if you want to 1000x the gamespeed as the only option for time increase, as it felt extremely horrible to tap move and still fly off into the sunset.",

      "I really liked this game a lot. \u00a0Very clever and unique mechanics.\u00a0\u00a0One small quibble, it's possible to move platforms into positions that you can't get them back from - suddenly making progression impossible (although\u00a0I don't know how you would stop that).\u00a0\u00a0Still, this was a great game - one of my favorites.",
      "The instructions with the magnet disappeared before i could read them but i did read them in the description, the magnetic ability was awesome, and the dashing and movements\u00a0work really well. Good job!",
      "Well done!",
      "This was fun! I really like the magnet mechanics it adds a lot to the game over basic platforming. Also I like the secret speedrun tech to finish the game in like 20 seconds haha. I did hit a softlock with the purple ball getting stuck on the ground and not being able to respawn it, but it's close to the start so not a huge deal to get back there. Great job on this!",
      "Nice idea, and I loved the gameplay, really cool",
      "Very interesting idea. It was fun messing with the platforms and using them to with other things in the environment to solve puzzles. Very fun!",
      "Cool game with lots of interesting mechanics.\u00a0 Controlling the magnetic platforms was tricky at first, but become a lot of fun.\u00a0 I\u00a0see much potential in this if developed further.",
      "Nice job, it is actually really fun, I loved the simplicity and the graphics, art design top marks, I would suggest having a skill tree to improve the jumping, in order to assist in those jumps, but nice one!",
      "that was awesome. I really liked the core mechanic and I think you've got the art of slowly building difficulty down pretty well. I think some careful adjustments would improve it, like having a little raised floor that stops the ball in the ball puzzle, or maybe have the ball stop when it reaches a really really low speed, because I got hung up on that puzzle (a puzzle which i thought was really cool and well-designed, by the way), but I got hung up simply on praying for the ball to stop when otherwise I felt I had solved it. If that makes sense.but yes stick with this core mechanic or reuse in future games, because it's a winner for sure",
      "Was fun playing this on stream!\u00a0 Really unique mechanic.\u00a0 The idea of pushing and pulling the environment is really cool.",
      "Great game, although a bit difficult for me. Similar to HalfSmore, I felt the game introduced mechanics too quickly. Honestly, I felt pretty confused. Although, that's not the point of the task, so I still gave you a great score because I see the potential and the mechanics were implemented well. The gameplay was still fun, anyway. Cheers!",
      "Fun game! The visuals were simple but could have been a little bit cleaner (for example some of the red was different shades). I'd also recommend reducing the amount of different colors. For example, black is clearly a platform and red is clearly death but one room in particular I walked in and now there's a lot more stuff introduced at once (even though the mechanics are mostly the same) which was kind of overwhelming. Speedrunning was fun and the controls felt nice. I'd recommend using a color palette (like fromlospec) just to give it a bit more cohesiveness visually, and it's a very small change that can be very impactful.\u00a0The UI was also just at random points in my screen which was a little bit odd. Hope you make it to the next round as I'm really excited to see where this goes!",
      "Fun game! The visuals and controls are clean and overall it's pretty fun! Seems like a fun speedrun game too, maybe leaning in to that concept could make it even better.",
      "pretty fun game with a pretty cool concept. i was able to win it in 25 seconds though by flying over the top of the map using the magnet board thing."

      "Wow this was really addictive. I could feel my arithmetic skills actually improving as I\u00a0played too, extremely well done!",
      "Good job! Really good way to improve my maths :)",
      "What are the odds, we basically made the same game.\u00a0\u00a0Only yours is definitely better than mine - way more polished.\u00a0 Obviously, I loved what you did and gave you a perfect score. \u00a0Really fantastic game!",
      "I detest maths yet i like this game,darn you! You made me enjoy math!! Just joking i really enjoy this game and the art looks amazing, reminds me off TTROCKSTARS",
      "Darn you exposed my poor math skills. I really like how simple yet fun it can be to solve equations under pressure. Reminds me of the MiT Integration Bee except we are doing algebra and in a fight for glory!",
      "This is so polished, it feels like a finished game.\u00a0Great work! You should put it on one of those educational gaming platforms ASAP!",
      "very polished game",
      "Really nice execution, everything feels smooth.",
      "Very fun, very polished game!",
      "You tricked me into doing math! Fun game!",
      "So cool to see you here on GDKO! Was so surprised to see another math game and then to realize it was from you hehe",
      "My inner mathematician took a lot of damage here, I was supposed to show everyone my master level skills but even the first attack was too much :(.However, this might be the first\u00a0good math game I've seen in my life!\u00a0Graphics and are all in place, I can see potential for further development. This could save our children.",
      "This game was so awesome, so addictive, and super well-polished! The math was really cool, I love the loop of doing two kind of inverse mental calculations, it creates a nice ebb and flow that makes the game really rewarding and allows the player to develop that specific skill as they play, which is probably my favorite type of progression in a game. This game would probably be really successful in school systems. It makes math fun and who knows, maybe it\u00a0improves mental calculation ability.",
      "This was much intense than i was expecting \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085I kinda expected to play around with it for a couple of mins but ended up getting a bit too into it and genuinly feeling the pressure when i only had one heart left!",
      "imma give this to my future kid to learn mafs",
      "What a good game!",
      "it is very cool. I will prompt too to do it like hungman, either to a more funny way or to more senssual way. eg. Add / subtract cloths. Or each part of the enemy have some numbers on it eg. head 1000 points that you must reach in order to take its head protection off etc.",
      "It's alright, though I'm really not amazing at math it turns out. Problem is, defense regularly calls for a 0, such as exactly 0, or 10, and 0 is not present on the in game calculator, meaning you literally can't block when the answer involves a 0 since math functions are disabled.",
      "Cool game! Neat twist on the calculator game. You not only have to calculate a number with limited options, you also have to solve an equation yourself by keying in the number with no help from said calculator. Love the art, too! I see the potential in this idea, it could even be a Steam game, possibly! No negative things to say. Will be sending to my math nerd friend.",
      "Looks so polished! Unfortunately I am terrible at maths :(",
      "I managed to get to the fifth opponent on the beginner\u00a0mode. Your game is extremely well presented and doing math like this is fun. I find it tricky dealing with negative numbers because my brain hasn't done that in such a long time but it was great to test myself. Having the attack and defence is a great mechanic especially as they were so different. It's also pretty cool having different opponents and the sounds are great!",
      "The game feels really polished and is fun. Would be cool to see the answer to equation we dont get right. Great game!",
      "Very well done! Now I have exam anxiety.",
      "Cool concepts and brilliant execution. Hope you develop it further!",
      "Even though it was difficult as hell to me(im dumb), I would love to recommend this to my freind",
      "This game was a lot of fun and it's really nice and polished. I felt so dumb every time I couldn't figure out an equation to attack the enemy lol. I would've liked there to be some end to the game as it seemed like it just kept going forever, or maybe I quit too early I'm not sure. I also thought the defense portion of the game was a lot easier than the attack, so I could've kept going for as long as I wanted, I just failed attacks sometimes. Great work on this it's a very good entry!",
      "I did not know a game about mathematics could be so exciting, I definitely felt a lot of pressure when attacking and trying to calculate all the possibilities in my head.",
      "This is an amazing entry. Very polished! I had fun doing math in my head, and that doesnt happen often.",
      "Very interesting game and very different from any other submissions.\nI see the calculator as the main mechanic. I think it would had been great to have something else to complement it instead of using it in two different ways, but I agree that you are actually asking the player to exercise two mechanics in their head :)",
      "This is a great game! Very highly polished, and fun! Made me realise that I am terrible at mental math lol.",
      "Well done! You've definitely taken advantage of my ADHD and made me hyperfocus on math equations for far longer than any of my\u00a0maths teachers ever could!Let me tell you, this game drew me in straight away and I played for 30 minutes before I realised there is no end\u00a0:')"

      "This was epic! Felt like a little movie :D",
      "Cool concept. My first game was a bit weird since i chose turret that didn't match the type of my wagon, so my train was not doing anything but still survived. Second game i chose carefully but i think my train blow itself after 2 seconds. Third run i think i managed to kill everyone. I think it's a bit messy for now but really curious to see more of this concept.",
      "This was a really cool auto battler, I don't think I've ever seen one in 3d like this. I liked the cinematic camera angles tho sometimes they clipped into the enemies and I couldn't see what was going on. I like all the different enemies and upgrading between waves, it's fun to build a big death train. I would've liked to be able to see mine and the enemies health bar during the fights, I couldn't really tell how things were going until the fight was over. Great work on this!",
      "The overall feel was great but there is so much that could be improved. The most annoying was the AI just running around and past the edge of the world becoming unkillable, the cannons felt awful as they constantly kept missing compared to every other form of damage (rockets op), the camera swaps should probably be upto the player instead of on a timer, and obviously the graphics could be better. Still the first 5 minutes were amazing, but wither rather fast.",
      "The game was fun, but I found that the camera was a bit too close, and made it hard to tell what was going on.",
      "Very cinematic experience! Fun and exciting!)",
      "Great concept! I thought I wouldn't be a big fan of autobattlers but something about the rooting for your train to outspeed or \"outgun\" the enemies was awesome. Large Railgun OP",
      "Something about this hit all the right spots for me. The train battles were great. This has a lot of potential.",
      "I really loved this. It felt badass seeing the cameras switch between the enemies and that train. Great take on a tower defence game. Hope you make it through to the next round, I feel like this game really has some potential. Good job!",
      "Train games are approved",
      "I love the idea of a train roguelike!In round 2, I would love to see a little more work put on the presentation, because I think the mechanics are good, but the UI and battle scene could be improved a bit to match"

      "interesting concept but its kind of hard. Would like upgrades and some music effect when interact with plants. swaping place or when it is fully watered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe some icon abowe plant if they need water or sun.",
      "Kinda surprised there was no mechanic where if you left the plant in either the sun or the water for too long they would also start taking damage. Maybe there could've been different types of plants that gain or lose their stats at entirely different rates. Currently it is a one and done deal without much to offer beyond the first play.",
      "A fun little game. Everything works together nicely.",
      "Its simple and fun! I like it!",
      "This is a simple but neat game. But I am unsure of what the secondary mechanic is. Drag and drop itself is a single mechanic. But great game!",
      "Cool concept. I agree with the other comment about swapping 2 plants. That would be a great addition for quality of life. I think there are many cool directions you can take this idea. For example, just having the rain come and go in different areas of the room\u00a0would add a great challenge to the game. Nice work, hope you keep at it.",
      "Lovely art, I love a plant-themed game. A few things I think will make the game feel more intuitive: letting players swap plants' positions without needing to move them to another position first. The detection of plant moving seems to rely on the mouse position, so sometimes, even though the plant sprite is in the placement area, it won't move because the mouse is outside of the area. I think it would feel better if the detection aligned with the plant sprite. Still, very good job!"

      "The movement was probably the smoothest out of almost 160 games I've played thus far, and thank you for a good checkpoint system. I didn't really get that far due to major skill issue but what little I played I did enjoy.",
      "WOW WOW WOW!",
      "Even though being short, this really gave me a feeling of playing a metroidvania. The abilities complemented each others and the shooting was visually rewarding. And while it probably were pretty linear, it gave me a sense of open-wordlness. Also visually pleasing, what a great entry.",
      "Very smooth movement. But damn it's hard for me.",

      "I enjoyed playing this game. Very nice movements and overall feeling of the gameplay. Hope to see more levele in the future:)",
      "Really fun metroidvania-y platformer. Was a lot of fun to explore the world and unlock new upgrades. I love the havoc that the gun unleashes when you shoot enemies and their platforms. I would've liked some optional more difficult sections as it was pretty easy overall. Great job on this! I got all coins and 0 deaths.",
      "2 words: perfect platformer",
      "Got all 88 coins! This game felt really polished. I liked how squishy the player felt and appreciated the small platforming details like you adding coyote time to the jumps.",
      "I like this game.\u00a0The animations made it a but hard to tell where my hit box was sometimes, but other than that this is a really nice game. The art adds to the overall feel, the gun both looks and feels awesome to use. Just a fun prototype!",
      "The game has a lot of character, from the art to the animations, to the particle effects.",
      "Excellent quality stuff, the physics are so perfect. Everything is so fast and responsive. Your priorities shine through brightly here as everything feels pixel perfect and very tactile. The mood and environment are also great. I see the buddings of a great game here :)",
      "very cool game style. It's also worth noting the very pleasant controls, it was cool. I liked this game;)",
      "good game but the movement felt for me waytoo bounce but nice game good sfx",
      "This is such a complete experience. I love the art and the music bangs super hard, but I need to focus on the mechanics for this round and honestly they are really awesome. The jumping feels juicy and controllable, the shooting mechanic is super super satisfying and the progression is really clear.What a fantastic entry, awesome work! (I missed 2 coins somewhere! :( :( )",

I clicked one banana and monkey started going to it. I\u00a0sent it a few times and then noticed two more bananas. I\u00a0was wondering how a monkey could fetch all those bananas, but when I saw that I have 3 monkeys there was no end to my joy.",

      "This looks awesome\u00a0and controls really well. I think it will be a really fun game when it is finished. Best of luck!",
      "This is a great prototype. I wish the screen was larger, and I'm excited to see what this looks like in round 2!",
      "I eat all blocks! I win? )",
      "The game looks interesting, it's just a shame that you can't enlarge the window, and also the jump button choice is strange",
      "Very cool start to a game! Would've absolutely kept playing this if there was more to it. I really like that you can eat a bunch of stuff above you it's fun to spam the eat button. Great job on this!",
      "I think this is a great start for a game. \u00a0I love the look of it (good color choices).\u00a0 I wish there was a little tutorial mode that kicked it all off (my game needs that too).\u00a0\u00a0Still, this was simple but fun.\u00a0 Well done.",
      "Very nice game! Only recommendation is to stretch to viewport, and make your camera bigger.",
      "I think what you have so far is really awesome! I'm really curious to see where you take this. Very clean animations too. Nice!",
      "Very interesting mechanics and a cool concept toomy experience when i played it is how the sense of progression doesnt really stand out to me and i didnt really get the idea on\u00a0how the puzzle works and the way to solve it. When i was\u00a0playing what comes to my mind\u00a0was i eat blocks and become the same color and stand between blocks that are the same color as my character but it doesnt seem to be the way to solve it. (this also probably bcs im bad at understanding lol)but the game is cool i really like the concept\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008c",
      "This is a fun game. Was hoping for a little variety with the different blocks, but I guess I'll have to wait until you develop it. Good luck, this was fun.",
      "Hey, I liked the movement controller very much, it feels great to control. A comment though is that I used the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmess\u00e2\u0080\u009d option and I think there was something weird when eating, it would not eat all blocks and sometimes it would eat blocks behind, not sure if I hit a bug or there is a mechanic around that. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the later maybe you can explain it in the game page. Also, the game looks a little too small. I believe you can still edit the itch.io page after submission, maybe you can add the fullscreen button?"

It was neat discovering and unlocking new abilities to progress. I can't wait to see where you take this!",

The camera would really benefit from some drag. It's a little choppy right now. It's also kinda tough to press S, J, and space while trying to navigate with AD. Otherwise, I\u00a0loved this!",

      "its nice and engaging game. loved the mechanics.",
      "I've been playing this for the last 20 minutes!! Really fun puzzle game! I agree with what other people have said about the switching the dice location quality of life changes. Apart from that, love it!\u00a0Would love to see how this game progresses if you choose to develop it further!",
      "Quite enjoy waking up doing a bit of math! it's puzzly although I find a lot fo the time using + and - is just easiest (or even ptuting in the number themselves works! (i feel like should have to do a formula)",
      "Really fun math puzzley game! The fact that this is your first game is crazy, great job! I like the mechanics of it in general and the upgrading between waves is really nice and adds more depth to the game. I kinda wish the special attacks refreshed after each round instead of being single use, cuz I found the game pretty tough with the death counter always coming for me. I ended up dying on wave 4 due to the death counter. It'd be nice if you could drag the dice back to any slot instead of the one the originally came from, I was trying to experiment and see what I could do with my dice and then it's kinda hard to drag them back to their spot and I didn't want to press R to put them all back. Great job on this tho it's really cool.",
      "Just Wow. The gameplay is really fun and with some polishing it could really be an incredible game. Didn't had any major issue or issues at all tbh. Some quality of life like the ability to exchange 2 dices location without having to put one in another blank space.",
      "This game had a bit of a learning curve but once I got the hang of it it was really fun! At times it was a little annoying to try and return specific dice to their starting spots, maybe consider letting the player right click a block to automatically return it to the set. Overall great game!",
      "This game made me feel really stupid.... and then really clever.... and then really stupid again \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085. It was fun and engaging and I spent quite a bit of time on it. Unfortunatly my best run was cut short because i clicked the \"PEDMAS\" title, not realising it would send me back to the menu!",
      "Wow, what a fun math puzzle game. Very well done. I think you got the core and secondary mechanics working together real well and they worked together to help defeat the enemy. Well done!",
      "Somehow turns math into a really fun and\u00a0difficult strategy game! Found myself playing it for way longer than I thought I would.\u00a0 The special abilities were fun\u00a0and really spiced things up.",
      "I really suck at coming up with equations to generate a number which made the game quite tedious to play, but that was on the tin so can't dock points for that. The UI elements, which makes up most of the game, were rather generic and could use some sprucing up if it were to go into real development.",
      "i was scared there was gonna be integration in higher levels,it was really fun",
      "I had a lot of fun playing! It would be nice to see more complex math in higher levels",
      "Very addictive.  with some QoL updates, it could be a banger!",
      "This is a pretty damn good entry. Though my brain would always shut off when quizes had these mathematical combinatorics games, I gave it a real try and was surprised at managing to match all the numbers. Well, all until wave 4 where I gave up as it is not my type of game, but pretty good work. One tip, I would recommend to put credits on the game page\u00a0so people are aware where the graphics are from, some jammers may get annoyed whet that is missing.",
      "Wow this was super duper fun! I ended up playing a lot longer than I intended to but I think you have a great couple mechanics working very well together here. The UI had a few bugs here and there but with some touch ups and polish (and added music) this would be absolutely perfect!",
      "Accidentally commented in the construct jam first lol. Anyway, missed games like these. Nice work!",
      "This was sooo cool. I\u00a0have visions of a blockbuster AAA title in your future with ideas like this.",
      "Cool game! At first I was a bit weary I'm not going to lie, but I had a lot of fun when I actually got into it! It really made me want to hold on to some of my numbers like my life depended on it lol.\u00a0(2, my beloved) Anyways, good job!",
      "Nice math game! Makes me think of computer labs in school growing up and getting to play something like this.",
      "i like this.. seems like a fun way for school kids to learn basic math skills..",
      "A fun and interesting arithmetic game.\u00a0 This is much better than the memorisation games I remember encountering.",
      "Nice game. As a quality-of-life feature I would suggest that dragging a number back to the top to an invalid slot should automatically move it to a valid slot (say, the first empty valid slot, or the closest valid empty slot). Also, you could have a \"clear\" button to restart your current turn.",
      "Well done! I enjoyed it! :D"

      "Good Game. Love the idea.\u00a0 But kind of Hard. you could give up little bigger reward after enemy dies like at least at the start or give up like reserve resource maybe like xp.",
      "Very impressive idea on having to switch your resources between health, movement, ammo. I really liked that idea! What are you planning on doing next???",
      "Interesting idea with the swapping around of stats. I can just hear the protagonist shouting 'I am out of bullets... I'll kill you with MY LIIFFFFEEE!!!!!\"",
      "Very cool game design! It wasn't immediately clear to me that I could refill resources by entering the circle that is left by defeated enemies. On the other hand, after trying once without refills you'll probably realize that there has to be a way to refill, and you'll naturally try to enter the circle.",
      "This is freaking cool! I love the concept where the movement, slowly drains the colors, and that you can also sacrifice your hearts for more ammo or movement etc.",
      "This is the best of all the games that doesn't have a cover image, actually fun game requiring strategy and evolving with more enemies. Would be a great basis for a bigger and more ambitious game.",
      "This is such a clever gameplay mechanic. I can't wait to see how this looks after round 2!",
      "The resource management was a fun concept that worked well with collecting the resources from the dead mobs. Very fun idea well executed.",
      "I really like the idea of rotating and managing your resources/abilities.\u00a0 Cool concept.\u00a0\u00a0Keep pushing that mechanic!",
      "Not the flashiest game I've played so far in terms of polish, but was pretty fun and liked the concept of managing your \"abilities\" by choosing which order to kill enemies. Great concept!"

      "Everithing from of this game is great!",
      "This is such a unique and interesting puzzle game. \u00a0I was a little confused at first, but then as I got the hang of it, I really loved it. \u00a0This is really great and I hope you get a chance to continue working on it.",
      "There is a bit of a learning curve but after that it is an incredibly fun game. The mechanics are all well done and the style is super charming. Congratulations on making a great game!",
      "At first I confused about how to play but it was fun to play and serving smooth gameplay. I also liked the animated part at start. Good job!",
      "Awesome game mechanics, that is really fun. Top marks for this. Also loved the art style.",
      "I managed to softlock myself by running out of black holes to get stuff from, but that's mostly a me problem. Very cool game, and well polished. I just wished it was a bit easier.",
      "Very cool game. It took me a bit to figure out how everything worked, but I was able to win on my 3rd try I think it was. Once I realized you cold hold multiple things it was really fun to optimize getting the people their requests. Great job on this I really enjoyed playing thru it!",
      "fun concept and fun game, maybe make the mixing os a lil finicky but i love it!",
      "This is a pretty unusual game. This is the first time I've seen such mechanics, and I really liked it. The art of the game is very cool)",
      "The art is very charming, the intro is very cool and sets a fun hook for the game. I agree with Loten about maybe breaking the tutorial a little but overall very interesting concept. I had some trouble where often I wanted to combine only two powder but 3 would combine instead. Maybe some cursor indicating what is going to combine may be an interesting helper to add.",
      "Fun and addicting game! I'll have to come back to finish it after I'm done rating games. Your tutorial is quite intimidating. Consider teaching a little as the player plays, instead of giving all the info upfront. It made much more sense while playing, and I learned quickly. Fantastic job overall!",
      "Not smart enough for your game )",
      "The concept is something like an old flash game but with much better graphics. The intro and tutorial texts felt a bit too long, but the game was interesting non the less.",
      "I like the idea of combining and selling stuff and art is\u00a0cute! I especially like the animations. I encountered\u00a0some technical issues tho. For example, the second time I relaunched the game I couldn't move at all. Also, I accidentally gave all my stuff away and was left with empty area. Luckily now I know what I did wrong (should've kept my black hole lol).",
      "This is such a cool game. At first I was completely confused, but once I got the hang of it it was amazing. The sound design is soooo cool as well. Love everything about this submission! So much potential in this game.",
      "The concept and visuals are very abstract!Really fun!",
      "(Copy from game page)This was super fun!  The controls page was initially very intimidating, but it didn't take  too long to beat. Even in this short game you had a great sense of  progression and I could feel the pressure building as a played more, The  game became a manic scramble to keep producing black holes to keep up  my resources while fulfilling my orders. Had a great time! I'm not sure  how you'll expand this but this is a great little game!",
      "This is some very interesting concept.\u00a0 I enjoyed going thru the portals and searching for the right objects. :)"

      "The turrets were rather easy as the vertically moving ones could be dodged by moving close enough to the boss, and the horizontally moving ones had too many gaps for them to be any difficult. I only managed to get one upgrade because I was prioritizing health, but I couldn't really get any progression from it, but not going to dock points for that because skill issue.",

      "The game is fun, I think different bosses would have helped the feeling of progression. But otherwise I think the top down shooter with upgrades works well and is a fun concept.",
      "I played a few times and accidentally figured out that you must shoot the powerups to buy them. It worked for me once I did that. That being said, with some additional bosses that have different attack patterns this could have potential.",
      "The idea is fairly simple, but I imagine it makes up for that with the upgrades! Unfortunately\u00a0 I wasn't able to get them to work no matter how hard I tried. Top-Down movement is always fun! Would love to see more attack patterns and variations through rounds in the future!"

      "This was a lot of fun. I love platformers and having the auto jumping mechanic was a nice twist I've not really seen much. I really liked the ramping up of difficulty and would've absolutely played more if there were more levels. I really love the art style as well! Great job on this!",

      "good game the one thing missing is the restart key its realy needed but apart from that realy polished game",
      "nice idea and i think it was pretty well implemented. taking away some of the choice of the player on choosing when to jump adds for a fun mechanic that works well with the difficult platforming.",

      "very visual, mechanic was difficult but playable, and that gorgeous background will be in my dev dreams. Good job, felt really complete :) I hope you had fun making it",
      "Great game!The concept is very interesting and unique.My only points of improvement if I were you would be to tighten the hitboxes, and maybe lower the audio levels",
      "nice game, but I think level nr 2 showed, that you  needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use the  secondary mechanic always",

      "The last level was a bit wonky as I couldn't figure out what the gimmick was so I just jumped the arrow, which didn't seem like the solution as it was having a spasm the entire time in the wall. No real depth, but the idea could easily be expanded upon.",

      "Still kinda clunky/buggy BUT has a lot of potential! The second puzzle was actually fun to solve and I believe there are so many things you could do with your arrow system. You got all my support now. (the linky player pig is also a peak of art)",
      "I liked the concept, the controls were a bit frustrating but it was fun. I think you got the two mechanics down and I think this concept can be taking in lot of different directions and I'd like to see where it goes.",
      "Cool concept! I would recommend adding some reset button, I didn't read the tutorial (thats on me) and instantly shot my arrow getting me stuck. Also messed up on the controls a few times pressing space thinking it was jump resulting in me getting stuck. Other then that I like the idea and it could be a fun puzzle game!",

      "Very fun to play. Well done my friend :D",
      "For some reason I had so many ties )))",
      "This was so fun! Such a unique concept, I really loved the poker and cooking crossover. I think I noticed one glitch, I had 4 lives, and I\u00a0had 4 wins, and won again. It took me to a \"you lost\" screen instead of a winning screen. This has so much potential, and I'd love to see where you take it!",
      "Great take on poker. The upgrading of the food was an awesome idea. I had a lot of fun playing this game.",
      "Quite challenging game. It's a bit difficult to get a good build going, but it's satisfying when you do. It felt like a lot of the time was spent waiting for the competition to finish, though. That's my only nitpick, you have a pretty solid entry.",
      "Of all the games I played this jam, this is the one I keep coming back to. Bravo.",
      "This is so fun. It took me a little bit to understand how everything worked, but once I got it I was making the best soup of all time. Such a great spin on the super auto pets auto battler type of game. I would've absolutely kept playing if the game were longer I was having a great time with it, I especially like being able to merge the ingredients. Great work on this it's very fun!",
      "This is such a clever twist on super auto pets. As a game, this is very good. As a prototype? Unbelievable. Incredible. Very well done my friend.",
      "Amazing game. I really enjoyed playing it. Saving this to my collection so i could play in my free time",
      "Really cool! Quite a complex game with the UI, but you managed to pull it off, well done! I wish it would show the specific things used in each poker hand as it gives the points, like 3 apples popping out of the stew when I get a three of a kind, that would make it even more engaging.",
      "I was cooking up a storm! If only winning hands of\u00a0poker was this simple in real life -\u00a0 I'd be rich :(A little scary to begin with but once I'd calmed down and read the instructions I was bankrolling. Could benefit from a tutorial playthrough but time was obviously a factor in that. Great game.",
      "This is actually a really fun game. I almost bounced off of it because I didn't understand it at first, but it's actually awesome once you get the hang of it.",
      "once i figured out how to play, i started slaying enemy teams with my monstrous masses of melon and salt. ty for some entertaining gameplay, i hope you had fun making it :)",
      "i think this is a millions of dollars idea to be honest, it's such a fun game with so much potential. it was REALLY confusing at first but i powered through it and managed to win a bunch of times with grapes and other fruit. it was a lot of fun! stick with it, and focus on making the game as readable and understandable\u00a0as possible, and you could have a seriously great game on your hands!",
      "i think this game could be potentially fun but it was to hard to understand\u00a0 what to do and how things were scored even after reading the instructions. Especially liked the\u00a0artwork. Did its job in\u00a0 drawing me in. Maybe make it a lil bit more clear on what to do",
      "These types of games are very dear to my heart!",
      "Core mechanic: Team builder.Secondary mechanic: Fight other peoples teams.Progression: after each fight you can update your current team.If I could develop further I would try and add more modifiers, some sort of chef system where you will be forced to cook a certain way (vegi, all meat,...) and also make this an async multiplayer."

If you slide just before the \"sliding section\" the character will get stuck, and certain spots have the collectibles stuck inside the scenery. Don't know how well the game fits the theme, so had to dock some points from that.",
      "I liked this a lot. \u00a0The penguin was adorable and everything worked great.\u00a0 I do wish it started out a little slower and we were zoomed out further (I would do jumps and then fall in chasms that I hadn't even seen).\u00a0\u00a0Still, I enjoyed this a lot and hope you get to work more on it.",

      "My brain too dumb. Good game",
      "Nice work! It's a pretty interesting challenge to make an entire game around the core mechanic of dying. I liked the salt puzzles and how the stiffs were a limited resource so you really had to think before you act.",
      "I am happy to see that you also made a game in cold environment. Game was clever and to be honest one of the best entries so far. I loved how simple it was and how hard it became.",
      "very fun game! Had a great experience playing and the sound effects are goofy and i love it!!",
      "This is a super puzzle game, it's a pity that there are so few levels",
      "This was a really nice puzzle platformer. I really like the mechanic of killing the person to turn into a ghost and possessing other people to solve the puzzles. I like the art style a lot and the lighting effects are a really nice touch. It took me quite a bit to figure out the salt bag bounces you back for the 6th and 7th puzzles, but other than that it was smooth sailing which was nice cuz I'm too dumb for jam puzzle games a lot of the time. Great work on this!",
      "That was challenging! I couldnt complete some of the levels, but I really appreciated the level select because it meant i found myself coming back to it inbetween other games and giving it another crack. Still cant figure 2 of them out though, maybe after some sleep I will be able to solve \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085.",

      "WOW perfectly excecuted game! The idea is amazing and well polished. Love to see more of this! :D",
      "Very creative mechanics. I love that there are multiple animations for player death. The puzzle design is quite clever. I really love the level where you have to observe the salt push back logic\u00a0to find the solution. I like that you didn't tell the player how it works directly and used puzzle design to help players learn. Amazing game!",
      "Really great game. Loved the salt/inscense bag repulsing the ghosts. good job on the tasks too - a well implemented primary mechanic, a well implemented secondary mechanic and a good sense of progression too! just a funny point - i dived as human and i think fell down and \"died\" but did not become a ghost and respawned as a human lol.",
      "cool concept and fun to play.",
      "Amazing! Very awesome concept and very fun to play. Difficult as well. 10/10",
      "Love this! So simple of a puzzle game, but so much room to take it far",
      "Lovely game. One of the nicest I've seen so far. The mechanics work very well together to create tough puzzles that make you think. I also like the effort that you put into setting the game's atmosphere with the art, ambient sound, and music. I would love to see more puzzles out of you! Solid all around, great work.",
      "Really really solid entry, and such a cool idea for a puzzle game! Keep going on this!",

No audio besides background music that sounded a bit too loud for my ears, the potions were very difficult to see against the backgrounds of almost same colour + too small, some of the areas were extremely difficult to differentiate so I got stuck without knowing there was a wall.",
      "The platforming feels tight! I\u00a0agree with the feedback of some of the others though, it was sometimes hard to see my character with the background elements and I'd get stuck on things I didn't expect. It took me a few attempts to notice the potions were dropping and the game felt better to play once I saw them.",

      "Control feels really fluid. The visibility could be better, sometimes it's hard to distinguish decor from gameplay elements. Very solid entry !",

      "Sprites, Pixel art, mechanics and music! Superb!",
      "I love the wall jump and music! and my highest score I got was 40-50 seconds left? It's hard to tell where the potions are in the heat of the moment. Maybe I would add a visual red arrow to the nearest potion from the player to help. Other than that, great job!",
      "Great controls with all the cool platforming actions. Tough to keep dodging everything. Well done! One thing I would improve is the visibility of the potions.",
      "Really fun game and played it multiple times, the character looks and moves really well and I love dodging everything, feels good. I think the best I got to was about 20 seconds left but not sure exactly as the timer disappeared. Everything is really good and only things I can think of that could make it better would be slightly more potions and a slightly slower wind speed at least to begin with",
      "That was really tough. Really enjoyed this one, though. Would like to see where you'd take this if you progress and decide you want to continue with this idea."

      "One of my favorite games this round. Great mechanics and very addicting.",
      "peak spaklerr, love the ar5 and the mechanics great!",
      "This is such a great entry. I do enjoy me some pacman from time to time and turning it into a turn based game made it a strategic joy. You did an incredible job polishing this it's very impressive for a jam submission. Great job on this I enjoyed my time playing thru it!",
      "YOU can chill for the rest of the rounds. This is already a round 5 game!\u00a0Would play this in my freetime :D",
      "The most ginished and polished game out of all. 5/5 for sure",
      "duuuuuude... your graphics made me so happy. CEO is such a vivid character in my head im so serious, I enjoyed that a lot, good job. i hope you had fun making it!",
      "A really like this game! The mechanics were simple but fun, and the visuals were great!",
      "The speech sound is probably my favorite sound effect of this whole jam! Really cool game, easy to pick up and play, with soothing visuals and sounds all around. Nice work!",
      "A very finely crafted game, congratulations on making this first and foremost!",
      "Great use of puzzle mechanics along with a high level of polish and detail. Looking forward to seeing updates",
      "Very good game, love the implication of the game mechanics. You definitely have me hooked wanting to play more levels! Love the art and the flow of the game!",
      "Great game, I'm impressed with the amount of depth you were able to get out of a mechanic like this. A few nitpicks:\u00a0it took me a minute at the start\u00a0to realize that the cursor was the location of my ship instead of something else like a target position of some sort. Might also be good to make the aggro indicator a bit more obvious, I\u00a0didn't notice it for a while (and for some colors like yellow it's hard to tell). Either way\u00a0it was very fun",
      "This was a great entry. Challenging but fair. I love the concept and had fun playing it. The dialog to provide instructions is great and the levels progress nicely. I just wish there was a more elaborate \u00e2\u0080\u009csecondary\u00e2\u0080\u009d mechanic, maybe some currency gained while exploring that enables something to get out of situations or provides more visibility of the map, or a way to distract/redirect the AI.",
      "Your game was so much fun to play! I loved the whole idea of moving around and trying to stay ahead of the enemies\u00e2\u0080\u0094it kept me hooked. Every move felt important, which made it really exciting.",
      "Definitely on my top 10 list for the jam",
      "Despite how few visual assets are actually on screen, its visually captivating!The game also manages to be a stress-inducing fun time, while simultaneously being the kind of fun you can sit back and play chillfully.",
      "Everything was on point! I appreciate how you could play the game as fast or slow as you'd like. You could all the time you needed to think about your next move or you could blitz though and win in a matter of seconds.",
      "It was fun puzzle game and graphics! good job. I am just questioning was there really two mechanic in it? Because we choose the next station as mechanic for both visiting stars and avoiding enemies",
      "This is one of my favorite games that has been submitted so far.\u00a0 The style is wonderful and the gameplay is unique and engaging. Great job!",
      "this game reminds me of graph theories for some reason.",
      "This was a lot of fun! Good Job.",
      "This is my favorite game so far.\u00a0\u00a0Loved the look of it.\u00a0\u00a0Loved the strategy.\u00a0\u00a0So professionally done.\u00a0\u00a0Really impressed.\u00a0\u00a0Only problem, I couldn't get it to work on Safari and had to use Chrome.\u00a0\u00a0Still, it was fantastic!",
      "Love the style of this game, and the puzzle is well executed too. It's already the complete package!",
      "Wow, this game is so polished, nice cute story. Enjoyed playing this,",
      "Very well made! Very relaxingI got stuck on a un-winable situation when I had a single triangle at the corner with a signal, and a single enemy following me, i can just go back and forth in the same place or die :(",
      "Waiting for app store release of this game! \u00a0I could never think of such a mechanic lol! So innovative.",
      "cant tell what the second mechanic is but i love the artstyle and vibe and the moving animations and impact feel crisp and lovely, great game!",
      "Very cool game, excellent idea, it was fun to play",
      "I love the changes you made to adjust the view range and ability to move to areas where enemies currently are. It makes the game feel smoother to play. Great job!",
      "Extremely well designed game, kept me playing through the whole thing. That last level was tough but helped me figure out some good strategies for navigating the game mechanics. Glad to have contributed to the ever-expanding market for space paste",
      "I really enjoyed your game."

      "cool game , a little hard at first , (i wasn't expecting the geist to no clip through the walls\u00a0to get me\u00a0 in the 2nd level)",
      "Very fun game like always, challenging as the spirits always\u00a0 got me and won't say my death count... haha.",
      "I'm so glad that you didn't have to restart the level every time you died, pretty sure I would've given up then. But I made it til the end with 19 deaths. Had to learn the timing to be able to defend myself, but then it was quite rewarding. I really like the visual and audio design, even if I got annoyed by the death sound since I died so much. Other than that, great entry! We totally have the same way of making games when it comes to trying to polish things from the get-go. :D",
      "Mommy I'm scared",
      "i accidentally press w and ctrl and it closes the tab and i gotta start over \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00adi really love the idea, the combination really fits well for the core and secondary mechanic really fits the theme you're going pretty welli liked it alot nice work man!",
      "nice game",
      "I know this is a mechanics round, but I just wanted to comment on the art and atmosphere because it is really really well done. The cutscenes were sick!The mechanics were well implemented I think, the juice when using the psych power was helpful and the process of tracking down the links and progressing towards the grimoire provided a really solid progression.",
      "Pretty great game! And the atmosphere was very creepy, I jumped a few times.",
      "This game has a great base (interesting story and puzzle mechanics). I think the keyboard controls could use some work, but no issues if I had a NES controller!",
      "Besides from the already mentioned issue about\u00a0character placement for interaction It was great, I loved the atmosphere and the mechanic over all, would like to see this developed further.",
      "Very fun, nice and spooky! Only issue I came across was that ctrl+w closes the tab lmao",
      "Art and story is soo good! Looking forward to the development of this project!\u00a0:D",
      "A very good atmospheric game! Solid work, almost too polished for the jam )",
      "Solid aesthetics. Nice hard puzzles.\u00a0Nice entry!\u00a0I too had the problem with \"hit detection\" on the book. Figured it out, though,\u00a0after maaany tries.",
      "Art direction and creepy feels were great. I died so many times to that darn thing. I think the biggest piece of feedback is making sure the robustness of the detection of the physic / switch and some\u00a0 others are improved as it felt like I was fighting it to make it work which made me question if I was doing it right.",
      "The art and overall style looks amazing. Love the atmosphere. The detection of the book feels a little bit off, and I need to try multiple times to attack. I think it would be better if the switch stayed revealed after you use psychic power on the door. Still a very great game. I am looking forward to seeing how you can expand this game.",
      "First of all, I like the general atmosphere and art is well done. But\u00a0I couldn't figure out how to use the book, I got it to shine once but nothing happened and aftewards the shine didn't reappear. Am I missing something? I would love to play the game more to see what you did with your mechanics!",
      "The graphical style is nice, but the game didn't really work for me. Couldn't get the enemy to die/progress? as it kept repeating the psychic attack(?) animation and the book didn't do anything. Also the game itself and my browser crashed ones trying to figure out how the game works.",
      "Wow, cool mechanics, it would be cool to see further development of the project.",
      "A very nice thrilling experience with a cool backstory. Both mechanics were well implemented well and essential to progress. I liked the little jumpscare when you die. Don't mind the 14 deaths, I was testing to see if I can juke them, but yeah ended up using the psychic power to push them away. Good stuff. Well done!",
      "fun lil game! love the pixel art, it was a lil hard to understand but other than that great job!",
      "Great graphics! I had some issues trying to trigger the psychic power in the right place, and at one time when I was playing with WASD and Ctrl I ended up closing a bunch of browser tabs (Ctrl+W), so I switched  to using the arrow keys after that.",
      "As always, art, sound, and polish are incredible.\u00a0 It took me a second to figure out how to play even with the instructions, but that might have just been a skill issue on my end haha.\u00a0 Great job!",
      "Cool SFX!",
      "Yikes a jumpscare! \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b1",
      "This is super fun :) I think that if this were a movie the twist at the end would be that we were dead the whole time... at least after the first 10 seconds... I died 23 times.That would be a good leaderboard, most deaths by poltergeist :)",
      "I tried to play it a bit, but I just never play scary games, hate to be scared!But yeah the art and music are nice and spot-on for those kinds of games.",
      "This game was great. I really enjoyed the mechanic that showed where the hidden levers and switches for the door was. I appreciated that the game kept doors and stuff open after getting killed, cuz I was getting wrecked in the first real level until I got a hang of everything. Great work on this it's really cool!",
      "This is an incredible prototype. The only problem I\u00a0can even think of is that some of the areas are wonky. Otherwise, great job! 10/10",
      "This was really fun! I like how the level doesn't fully reset when you lose. The art and music were great and really fit the theme of the game!",
      "impressive that you made this in 2 weeks! good job!",
      "Glad to see some of your art back in this competition, looks really great. Hitboxes are a bit tight for my taste. Love the setup and curious to see more of this !",
      "Solid game! It's hard to time your repelling blast when they beeline towards you, due to the delay, because sometimes I blast the moment one starts its attack but I'm still too slow. But I'm happy that the progress through a level doesn't reset after a death :D it does remove some of the fear of dying, but otherwise I don't think I would've finished the game.",
      "you scared me haha.My only complaint is that it is a bit hard to hit the stuff even if you think you are close",
      "man the art is amazing! I love how the ghost sprites fade in and out, move through walls and are sort of visible. The SFX, the jump scares! THE COZY ROOMS I MEAN WOW! I want to live there if it wasn't for the ghosts (great design on their faces as well!)",
      "the art is really goodand i also liked repelling the ghost as it screams",
      "Very cool game concept, I like the mechanics you have in place a lot! My only issue would be that the timing of using your psychic power to repel gheists getting close to you felt very finnicky, I had multiple times where I was using it as they were next to me and they seemed to ignore it and still get me. With that fixed though (or maybe explained more, I could have been missing something) then I could see this being fantastic overall!",
      "With 55 deaths I\u00a0guess I've put some effort. Good amount of polish and captivating atmosphere. The spirit's reactions to player made it really creepy, you can just feel its rage. I\u00a0was quite annoyed in 2nd level until catching the ropes, most of my deaths happened there I think. It sure was clever decision to not reset level on death.",
      "As always, your art looks great. I might have to get my daughter to play this one and see if we can get some jump scares out of her. Fantastic job!",
      "interesting game! I already liked your games from last year, and this one catches that same vibe. I really ejoyed the experience."

      "Great title. \u00a0I'm impressed with how much you got into this game. \u00a0I would love a tutorial to get me started (my game should have on too). \u00a0But, overall this was fun and nicely polished for a prototype.",
      "This is great! Well done",
      "Love your game so far. It's neat how your pumpkins ripen and are converted into a sort of a score at the end of the night. Game is a bit hard at the start, though. Would love to see this continue!",
      "Fun game! Your gameplay loop is really nice and feed into itself very well, but I think it could afford to get more difficult as time progresses. I'd also like to see some sort of\u00a0tooltip on the pumpkins to see what they do as it took me a little bit to figure out some of them. It's a really good base game though, kept me hooked for quite a while!",
      "This was a ton of fun. One bug I ran into, I think the health might have gone negative and I could not die. Other than that fantastic!",
      "Great theme and idea!",
      "I really enjoyed this game. It's crazy to me that someone else thought of making a bullet hellish survivors type game mixed with a farming game and it's so different than mine still. I really liked planting my pumpkin seeds and having them help defend against the ghosts and shooty guys. Unfortunately I ran into a bug where my health bar was empty but I couldn't die so it just kept going forever, but I think my health bar became empty towards the end of night 3 with like 250 of the things harvesting pumpkins give you for my high score.",
      "Great game! Loved the farming and mob wave mechanics. Very tough for me, I'll have to give it another few attempts.",
      "WOW AMAZING WORK! I love the cover art and the big pumpkins. Very fun and unique game! I would like to have some type of visual indication when I get hurt, also making the \"monsters\" disappear when daytime comes would be great!Good Job! :D",
      "epic",
      "I really liked the concept of this game. I was terrified at first when I was just farming peacefully then i got ambushed by ghosts LOL. I kinda wish that the difficulty ramped up more slowly, but it's a prototype after all. Nice work!",
      "Cool game! I like that it is basically a tower defense type of game but you kind of grow your tower (Pumpkin). The mechanics are very creative, and the art is very appealing. The suggestion I have is to make a separate UI counter for seed husk since it is not an item you can directly use. I also wish there was some text information explaining what your pumpkin does. You have many different kinds of pumpkins in the game, but in my mind they feel the same because I don't know their functions. Still a very great game - looking forward to this game being expanded in future rounds!",
      "Great submission! I was a little confused at first but the game was really goof for figuring new things out every time i played! Once i figured the loop out i was unstoppable! (untill i died). I played through a couple of times and got a little further each time. I think you said in a reply that you had lots of ideas and wanted to implement a shop system, I think this would be really good and build well on the core mechanics you have already implemented.I thoguht the pixel art was very nice. especially the vines wrapped around the health bar and the pumpkins. The effects of the seeds turning into pumpkins was very satisfying too, especially when you had a bunch of them and watched them all change in a row!The enemies that shot you had just the right level of frustrating behaviour. They always seemed to just dodge away, but it was really satisfying when i finally managed to group them all up and mow them down.The music was nice and fit the atmopshere well witout being distracting.",
      "nice",
      "Trying this again after the immortal state is gone and it is quite tough trying to chase those eyes and dodge their attacks while also getting chased by ghosts lol. Fortunately though the attacks on holding LMB really helped this time and I could survive forever but had to stop at 393. The healing pumpkin really helps you survive, more so when getting a couple of them next to each others. I also agree with the suggestions below regarding knockbacks and peaceful morning. Very fun game! Good job!",
      "rated it, reminds me of anime where he farm at day but go adventure at night. forgot the name tho, saw a bug, I cant die. I dont know how it happened maybe you forgot to put death state in some cases.all in all good mechanics. if you going to use other assets try to pick a color palette in Lospec and recolor the assets with it so it will be coherent with each other. or maybe thats you assets IDK, wish I can scroll up and down to pick the items inventory for quick access of it insteead of pressing key numbers. good take on the jam no doubt you're in top 50, would love to see this develop further, Good Luck! \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u0096\u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00a1\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00aa",
      "Lovely game - well done!! I think you nailed the two main mechanics. Only wished for the ghosts to disappear during the day, but that's me being a bad gamer HAHA Nice one!",
      "Wonderful game!",
      "Excellent work!"

      "Idea of the game is cool and you implemented it pretty good. As a suggestion I would like to lose life when went off the screen borders, I stuck many times on platforms also I am not sure about the secondary mechanic.\u00a0Keep developing and you will get better for sure!",
      "Well this one was quite buggy on all fronts. Just by not playing you instantly run into a platform's side and get stuck, if you manage to get out of that you fall right through the ground. Some of the surfaces remove HP while others don't seem to do anything. Graphical style was the high-point, but that's most that can be said.",
      "I liked the look of this game and I like runner games. \u00a0But, this game started out to hard for me.\u00a0 I wish it was easier at the beginning and then the difficulty ramped up over time. \u00a0I hope you get a chance to continue working on it.",
      "Nice game but too easily you get stuck on clouds or you can go out of boundaries.",
      "Its cool! The only thing is that you get stuck easily. That one fix would make this a fantastic game!",
      "Fun concept! Unfortunately\u00a0 I think there's a bug when hittinh the side of the platforms, the game seems to get stuck and it forces you to restart ? But I'd love to see more!",
      "I like these gravity switching games. It was fun but I had to quit after getting to level one because I kept hitting the side of a platform and I got bored waiting. Anyway, the game was fun to play I think you could add a bunch of stuff, it has a lot of potential.",
      "It's a good implementation, but we need to balance the speed of the game a little more.",
      "Fun idea!",
      "You have the vibe down, and it's a fun mechanic. I did get stuck on some platforms and had to restart. But its a fun game!"

      "This game was really fun. It was so stressful getting all their groceries scanned while the customers got more and more angry, but in a fun way. It was cool that you could drag all 3 items on the belt across at once too. I liked the upgrade mechanic when taking breaks a lot, added some nice variety to the game as things progressed. I\u00a0think I ran into a bug where I could take my break past the time and my stress level would keep going down rather than skyrocketing like I think it said in the tutorial. I didn't abuse that tho cuz I wanted my score to be legit so I always ended my break on time! Great work on this it's super fun!",
      "Ah, this brings back bad memories. Fun game with some interesting mechanics. Well done!",
      "I\u00a0would never wish this job on my worst enemy. Great job!",
      "",
      "The GOAT! One of the most stressfull games that i've played. It was a really fun and interesting gameplay. Very cool idea with breaks and upgrades during them. Very good game, i loved it. I got 24000$ highscore, but leaderboard didn't load((",

      "such a\u00a0stressful job! Loved the tutorial slides, the visuals and the stress indicators (screenshake and colours etc)",
      "Love the game! However I need to get back as my break is over!",
      "Cool idea and very well made, good job!",
      "Boss, I made you a GAZILLION $$$$!I hope I can finally get that promotion now...Super fun and adictive game!\u00a0Well done! :D",
      "Great game! I think the red stress overlay when you get close to losing\u00a0makes me actually stressed\u00a0while trying to click on the tiny apples lol",
      "nice art, nice music, nice sense of progression, very smoothly implemented mechanics, this feels so complete and polished. Great work! Very addictive too!",
      "Fun idea and a lot of good juice!\u00a0I can see a lot potential for\u00a0a further development as well. Maybe you could even\u00a0take some inspiration from how papers please handles its level design?\u00a0Also\u00a0you could maybe add\u00a0some breakable groceries as well since now I just threw everything to the bags as quickly as possible.\u00a0But it's quite fun as it is too, so well done!",
      "I played this game a lot during development and it's really addictive. The difficulty curve is perfect and the break system is just forgiving enough to give a moment of brief respite from the frantic clicking. Definitely one of my top picks for round 1",
      "Very nice! Would like to see this developed further!",
      "yoooo this is a fantastic game. The music that gets faster and climbs in pitch toward the end, the art, the angry customers, it's all just so great. VERY nice work!",
      "Hmmmm.... i may have got a bit lost in playing this....",
      "Really impressed with how much you got into this game.\u00a0\u00a0Starting with an easy to follow tutorial - I wish more games had that (mine included). \u00a0This was challenging, but fair and I really liked the upgrade system. \u00a0Very well done.",
      "Well designed and cool game! Changing the tempo of music regarding the stress is clever move, good job!"

      "This game was awesome. I really like the fast movement and once I got a hang of the controls it was really fun to use both dashes to navigate the levels. Great job on the art and effects too the game looks really nice. I like that it got pretty challenging towards the end too, would've been nice if there were some optional collectibles that really cranked up the difficulty. I beat the game in 450sec, great work on this!",
      "Nice entry, i had some difficulties with understanding for which things I should boost, and i got myself softlocked in the later level (it had bright surroundings, i think it was thime cathedral or something). Before the level started, where the countdown happened, i pressed left mouse button a couple of times so when the level started i was already in mid air falling to my death. Unfortunetly it saved when i was falling, so i couldnt recover myself.Other than that a great entry, good job!",
      "Very nice looking and nice mechanics.the secondary dash feels a bit unnecessarily tricky imho, but i get the idea :)",
      "Super fun to play on stream.\u00a0 Overall game design?\u00a0 Top notch.\u00a0\u00a0I love the visual design and the audio.",
      "This is a very challenging platformer. I really like the idea (as you can see from my game, I also implemented a dash mechanic) but I found the mouse control a little confusing and overall a little to difficult given the speed and tight expectations to make some jumps. I think its a difficult problem because I also tried allowing players to aim with the mouse and then decided to backtrack it so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all keyboard based. I saw you played mine and you seemed to like the mechanics, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear more of your thoughts on my control scheme. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still debating and may change it for next round if I make it.",
      "Such a good game, feels very polished. Well done :D",
      "It's gorgeous!\u00a0Feels very unique to control.",
      "Well made game, I enjoyed it",
      "This is an example of a submission of the first round man, this game is perfection!",
      "",
      "Very juicy abilities, love the speed/distance trade off. Good length for a jam game too, didn't feel too long.",
      "One of the best games ever.",
      "First off, this game is hard, but very rewarding once you get the hang of it. Very well designed levels, gameplay-wise and art-wise.",
      "Best I could do after some attempts is 186",
      "neat game visually speaking it's eye catching. the gameplay is superb tho Im not very good at the no movement mechanics of it. also sometimes if you got too close in a wall the projectile you spawned will get destroyed so leaving stuck in a wall. like step sis. (sorry, I had to say it.)my only suggestion is that the text could do a bit more fixing since it feels like its blending with the background its hard to see it sometimes. too many bright things.",
      "Yoo, for sure 5 out 5. Controls are very smooth (i needed some time to figured it out how they work, but then i was destroying those level :). Levels was really well made. they are so different and yet interseting. It was a challenging experience and i really enjoyed playing it. Well done!",
      "My current favorite. It's already amazingly polished, the movement is satisfying, the gameplay is polished, and it felt great finally learning the controls. It definitely had a learning curve, but that's not a bad thing. You definitely outdid all of us :D",
      "The controls feel familiar yet fresh, which is hard to come by for platformers. Although, It took almost until the end of the jungle level before I properly understood the controls. The gameplay was really fun!",
      "don't understand this time patroller plot but the game is great with cool graphism .the mechanics are fun and makes the game fast and dynamic",
      "neat game with cool a fun mechanic. its a bit hard to play on a laptop without a mouse, though",
      "Maybe unusual to start my comments here, but I loved the sound of it - it really enhanced the game play.\u00a0\u00a0Movement also felt incredibly smooth and reactive. \u00a0Interesting mechanics and tricky levels.\u00a0 Maybe a bit too tricky for me at the beginning (I wish it was easier for longer). \u00a0Still, this is a great game and I hope you get to continue with it.",
      "What a fun concept. I liked the mechanics and the puzzle levels. Had to get used to the movement a lot but it was a really fun game.",
      "I had a lot of fun playing the game! Once I got the hang of the controls, it was fun to zip around",
      "Very cool and unique combination of movement mechanics. Your usage of environmental objects like the light blue thingies and the cracks were really great for making the world rich, colorful, and allowing for extra jumps/ cool stunt opportunities.I felt that maybe the camera might be a *bit* too jittery? Maybe I'm wrong, I love how fast it feels, but sometimes it feels difficult to read the text on screen because its moving around too much. That being said, your color palette decisions are off the charts good. You have a great sense of style and platformer level building. Can't wait to see where this one goes!"

      "Haha, funny enemy descriptions and art style. It was fun to play. I just wasn't quite sure if it was just me or if the shield wasn't working, or if I didn't understand the mechanics - I thought it was supposed to prevent damage to me, but maybe I missed something. Otherwise, it's great how you made a classic game more diverse/varied.",
      "Loved the art style and all the wacky cards and enemies. Using rock-paper-scissors as combat logic makes it very easy to understand. I had a lot of fun playing this. Great job!",
      "such a hilarious game, the wiki page got me laughing from the start!",
      "Really cool deckbuilder game! I like the rockpaper scissors mechanic with the different card types, it's got some fun strategy to it. I also got a good laugh out of the how to play menu being a screenshot of the wikipedia for rock paper scissors lol. Great job on this!",
      "This game is very cool! I like trying to figure it out as I go.\u00a0\u00a0Love the card too, and\u00a0how \u00e2\u0080\u009chow to play\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00a0linked to the how to play rock paper scissors article.",

      "Neat, another deck builder! +100 points just because I know how hard they are to make. Your fun little take on rock-paper-scissors kept me playing until the end. I do wish there were a way to see the deck, remove cards, and skip cards during selection, but I understand how challenging it can be to add more features. No points taken off for that. Fantastic job!",
      "This was so fun and funny! It impressed me :D",
      "It's quite a fun game, it would be great to see an update on this idea, and it would also be possible to work on balance and randomness. I liked it)",
      "I lost to Ed Scissorarms and he stole my arms... Will expect full reimbursement for damages... (Fun game... the enemies were particularly charming and I had a lot of fun getting destroyed by a deck comprised of only scissors lol. I hope you make it through just to see what else you make.)",
      "Very unique idea. I would add a bit more to the card playing/drawing animation to give it a bit more life.",
      "Impresssive! This game aligns with the task perfectly! I had fun while playing this and I was amazed to see the great progression of different cards and levels. Drawings look fun, but would suggest to play a bit with color theory.",

      "Hilarious game, the enemies description are pure comedy, just like the death screen. I had a lot of fun",
      "What a fun twist on a classic formula! I love the constraint of only have 2 cards in your hand so there is always an imbalance. Really smart design and a fun gameplay loop.",

      "no way a golf game i really like golf games id say the game is pretty well executed the sense of progression really stands out and the mix between rewind and shooting ball does fit with each other",

      "Classic precision platformer. Good job buddy.",
      "`The controls feel good. my only complaying is that the dash button wastes a dash doing nothing if you dont press a directional button",
      "Cute game. Is there only 1 level or I am so bad that can't reach that block?",
      "I accidentally left my comment on the actual game page lol my bad.\u00a0But anyway:",
      "Great platformer. The controls feel great and I can easily land on tiny platforms and go through tiny gaps. But I wish it had some checkpoints so I don't have to go back to the starting point every time I die. And I think the trail following the player flickers in the top left corner when you die? Not sure why. But still, very great job!",
      "Very cute little duck )",
      "This was a really fun platformer. I like the dash mechanic and the duck character is very cute. I like the challenge of the game, but some checkpoints would have been really nice for how punishing it is with all the single tile jumps you need to get the duck into. Overall really enjoyed this tho!",
      "Great platformer! Cool soundtrack, and the mechanics aligned with the Jam Task really well!DUCK",
      "That's the duck game :) The skill curve was a bit steep. I\u00a0wish there was a closer checkpoint in level three near the one block gap. I fell there quite often and had to redo the level. Otherwise nice jump and run mechanics, and I think you\u00a0also\u00a0implemented coyote time.",
      "duck mentioned 10/10 (\u00a0coyote jump/time is so nice)",
      "what the duck",
      "Hey ducky! The jump and double jump feels great and the impact screen shake adds some pretty cool juice. I found the key binding for the dash to the down arrow a little confusing, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to change; the issue I had is that I do not know why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d use the dash given that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too long and I could probably reach most areas with the double jump instead of the dash; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that may require some careful level design to create interesting puzzles. Great job overall.",
      "Great rage platformer. A lot of fun.",
      "This is Ducking Good! Well done! I love the weight of the duck :P",
      "This game is just hardcore Celeste. No but seriously, I enjoyed platforming a lot!\u00a0Good art, effects and music. Controls were also well done, even though my bad dashes frequently killed me I always felt like it was fair.",
      "This was fun. :) Good Job!",
      "loved the game. the controls are cool too.",
      "Firstly, I love the duck. Also the controls feel really nice, and I especially love the effect when you land after a double jump, although it almost makes me wish the normal jump and dash also had a bit of juice. There were a few issues I had with the movement though.\u00a0Firstly, fitting into one block gaps felt terrible there are a lot of them. Also, I think that the levels needed checkpoints. The music also looped over again with every death and together those made a rather grating experience. I also think the levels could have just been much shorter, as I would rather play 9 short levels than 3 long levels ten times out of ten. Since it's a game jam, not everybody will be willing to put the time and effort to be difficult or annoying games so I would highly recommend making them way easier than you may think they need to be. Also the jump pads don't allow you to double jump again and it feels like they should. I know I gave a lot of criticism but I did have a fun time, and if Rubber Ducky is coming back later I'd love to see some of this feedback taken into account. Great job & good luck!",
      "Rubber Ducky is my hero ngl(Love his little post-double jump ground pounds too)",
      "Love the look of this game - the duck and the trail he/she leaves behind. \u00a0I'm pretty terrible at precision jumping, so I wish this started off a bit easier.\u00a0\u00a0But, overall, I thought you did a good job with this platformer.",
      "duck",
      "Simple and cool! And you got duck too lol. Mechanics are smooth which is critic for platform games and liked the tail effect.",
      "Simple but very fun and challenging platformer!\u00a0I really like the ground sprites!!!",
      "I like the feel of the dash.",
      "The third level was already too hard for me and having to restart didn't help so I had to stop there, but this game is an achievement in atmosphere and cuteness, and I think animation+ctronols are smooth.",
      "An enjoyable platformer, love the character and\u00a0the great music, and the effects when landing and when moving in the air are amazing."

      "Fun mechanic! I can't help but feel like the jump is less useful when you have the ability to teleport to the knife\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085 and I'm not sure the advantage of throwing it quickly? Maybe you'll add some tighter timing on later puzzles. This was cool, good job\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008f",
      "Very good game with a lot of potential, the only problem is some collision do not match with the sprite shape",
      "Well it was short like it said in the title. I couldn't for some reason get the slow? knife to work at all as it just kept moving at the normal speed. Some collisions were either a bit too big or apparently none existent (specifically on the last levels top row's bottom). Could easily be expanded with more levels and maybe some more mechanics.",
      "Lovely idea! Good work! :D",
      "Love the idea for this game, it's very fun to throw it fast and then teleport at the right time!",
      "I think that the two mechanics work well together. I like the choice in power to throw the knife and can see a lot of potential puzzles/action using that in the future. Great idea and good work implementing it.",
      "I liked the game and the mechanic. I wish the knife could move faster. Great mechanic otherwise!",
      "A very clever, if short game :) How good was the throwing / teleport mechanic....? I forgot I could jump and was stuck for like 2 minutes until I remembered that I could just hop to the next block. ( I might just be tired) Good job, keep it up!",
      "This game has a really strong potential to become something awesome!\u00a0Throwing knives at Mach 3 and timing teleports is genuinely so fun It's hard to explain. I really like the Stanley-Parable\u00a0esc narrator you added! This game somehow managed to throw some of my favorite game mechanics\u00a0in blender. Needless to say I enjoyed it!",
      "I thought that was\u00a0fun!",
      "I liked this a lot!\u00a0 Your mechanics felt really well defined, and bouncing the knife around and teleporting to it was a lot of fun.\u00a0 Great job!"

      "Brother to Inscryption. Everything was great with this game and when I was out of cards I was a bit in a stress. Clever mechanics and clean art style.\u00a0 Just perfect!",
      "Incredible game! The art is great and the mechanics work well. Can't wait to see what this game becomes in futur rounds",
      "Really really great game! A well-designed card game with a real-time twist, and awesome dark aesthetics and nomenclature. Excellent job!",
      "I love the style so much. The mechanics were also very well implemented. I loved that you are allowed to use cards on enemies and get negative attack point on them, so their attacks heal you. This could be a really fun rogue-like deck builder if you decided to expand on it.",
      "Oh man, this is great fun. I also REALLY love the polish around it, this might be the best looking and feeling game on the list so far! I did need a bit of time to figure out what was going on, so it might have needed more of a tutorial, but asides from that it's very engaging!",
      "The gameplay is quite unique and engaging.\u00a0The\u00a0auto-battling\u00a0function\u00a0might\u00a0cause\u00a0you\u00a0to\u00a0panic\u00a0at\u00a0first,\u00a0but that\u00a0only\u00a0leads\u00a0to\u00a0your\u00a0quick\u00a0demise.\u00a0Taking\u00a0it slow\u00a0and\u00a0thinking\u00a0about your\u00a0actions\u00a0is the\u00a0way\u00a0to\u00a0go.\u00a0I\u00a0also\u00a0like\u00a0the\u00a0feel\u00a0of\u00a0placing\u00a0the\u00a0cards,\u00a0you\u00a0did\u00a0nice on\u00a0that\u00a0front.\u00a0Keep\u00a0it\u00a0up,\u00a0would\u00a0love to\u00a0see\u00a0this\u00a0game\u00a0continued!",
      "Really cool game! I like the theme you went for and how it felt strategic to either cast your cards or sacrifice for my mana. Definitely need to see this be fleshed out",
      "Oh man I wanted to try this one as soon as I\u00a0saw it on stream and it did not disappoint. Extremely well done! Reminds me of Inscryption in all the right ways, and your mechanics work really well together. No notes (other than maybe an interactive tutorial for the future) but can't wait to see what you add to this if you keep working on it!",
      "This game has come a long way since the first one I played weeks ago and all in good ways. The strategy feels better and the game is easier to understand. A freaking amazing game! IMO a top 5 game for sure.",
      "This game is really nice. Not my cup of tea normally, but I really liked this one. You did a good job, and I think your tweaks made the game feel so much better!",
      "Wow one of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6if not The BEST Itch.io Card Game!\nThe core and secondary mechanic works well and compliments each other\nThe soundtrack is also amazing!\nNo wonder you gave me a great idea to improve on my card game \u00f0\u009f\u0098",
      "This was awesome! An active time card battling game is not something I've seen a ton of but it's a very fun concept and you executed it really well. The ability to use your cards to lower enemies attack into the negative and heal your own card is so cool. The constant ticking timer of the enemies attacks coming really leads to some fun stressful strategizing. Great work on this I really enjoyed it!",
      "Another rage inducing game! LOVE IT.\u00a0 It took me a couple tries but finally beat it!\u00a0 Are you wanting to expand it any?",
      "The GOAT. Your game is awesome. It's nice to see how the game improved comparing to the early iterations, haha. Well done!",
      "Great Game! I ragequitted on the first 20 seconds but, ehhh, no body cares about that",
      "Great game. Great atmosphere. Great Ui design.",
      "Definitely top 10 material",
      "Solid entry. The atmosphere is indeed great. Played it a bit before the deadline and tried it again now after the new patch, with the new UI and gameplay changes it feels much better. I could not beat the top guy's 1:09 time but I had lots of fun while trying to do so.One small note regarding the leaderboard is that it seems\u00a0 to add a new entry after refreshing the browser even when entering the same name instead of updating an identical existing one on better score, which ends up clogging the leaderboard, especially when we keep refreshing on bad starts. Not that big of an issue though since the focus is on main mechanics and they are very well implemented.",
      "\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\u00a0Love the atmosphere + gameplay possibilities (boss progression is perfect too)",
      "Great atmosphere and fun mechanics that give the player a lot of freedom to experiment with and strategize!",
      "Really great concept and shockingly good polish and visual style considering those weren't required.\u00a0 Excellent as expected!\u00a0 I can see this being a top ten for sure!",
      "I was confused at first, but I had a ton of fun once I understood how the game works",
      "One of the bests! Really cool graphics and tasteful gameplay. Finished it in 3rd try,I believe the trick to win is make your opponents attack negative so you can farm health of your hero :P",
      "You sacrifice your time to make this game."

      "Wow, I'd been looking forward to playing this one just from the art style but it did not disappoint in gameplay either! The combat system was a little difficult at first but I was able to pick it up before long, at a really good pace actually. The boss fights were varied and interesting all around. Really great game, would love to see you keep working on this!",
      "This is a great entry. I really like the art style and the gameplay seems cool but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d echo what Brainfart mentioned below and I could not get the input scheme to work for me. I could be ok with the right click to move but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer if it was allowed to keep it holder for continuous movement. Still, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather have a twin-stick OR WASD+mouse movement.\nAlso, I the scissors go way too far out. I lose track of where they are. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be nice if they stayed closer and maybe inflict continuous damage OR stay in-view so I can plan for them to damage something on the way back to me when I recall them.",
      "Man, this was fun playing on stream.\u00a0 Like I said, your overall game design is always spot on.\u00a0 Definitely one of the styles on my inspiration list.\u00a0 (Ugh...Riri!)",
      "This game is so awesome, one of my favorites from the jam for sure. Once I got a hang of it it was really fun to kill all the bosses, the only one that gave me trouble was the one that leaves a fire trail behind it. I think the story and vibe of the game with the art and music is just great. The controls are pretty weird, I'd really like to be able to hold the mouse to move rather than having to spam click constantly while playing. Really great work on this I loved it.",
      "great game and art and cinematic star-wars sequence at the beginning! The bosses felt really strong but rewarding once you beat one of them (the reduced FOV guy was especially strong). Nice work",
      "Very fun game! Good job :D",
      "Ay, very nice game! Was a bit confused about controls, but than i figured it out. Beat first boss without taking damage on 3rd try :) Well done! Hope to see this game in the next rounds",
      "AMAZING GAME! Amazing art Amazing story and i like how the mechanics lead into eachother! but i do have a couple nitpicks, the characther moves way too slow, and you can accidently dash WAY too far by just holding left click, this makes the game really a game of tanking damage and kill it before it kills you, which really decentive me from replaying it to get no-hit runs, the first time playing it its way too hard, and the second way too easy!! but overall still an amazing game, i had fun with the easier bosses where i could actually dodge and kinda run away the feedback is only kinda directed to the harder bosses",

      "I really like the idea but I found the game a little too difficult. It may need a little more aid to help identify where things are. If you play minesweeper you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a single number, every time you uncover a spot you may get up to 8 adjacent numbers. Then you can use overlaps and the numbers to figure out safe spots. I started playing and I was lucky that I placed a box and I got a 0, then I was safely placing boxes on the 4 corners of each box, as if it was traditional minesweeper and that was a good strategy, I could not devise any other strategy otherwise. I may also recommend/ask if there was a way to start a level with at least one shape placed in a safe spot to have something to start with.",
      "Oooh, like minesweeper but tougher. Great game, very challenging.",
      "This is a really cool idea. It's really challenging, need to go back and try again to see if I can win a round. Great job on this, I love minesweeper and it's cool to see such a unique spin on it.",
      "",
      "Woah... I really loved this game, it's super hard but there are plenty of tools in the arsenal to figure it out. My personal favorite is the duck shaped detector.",
      "Great spin on Minesweeper. Although I had problems beating it :D",
      "This is a really clever and unique take on MineSweeper. \u00a0Much harder, but also much more rewarding.\u00a0 Definitely one of my favorite games so far. \u00a0Excellent!",
      "Omg this is insanely good! What a great idea / execution, I had so much fun. Didn't win yet tho, I will definitely return to complete this\u00a0after I've tried out all the other games.",
      "Very cool idea with a lot of potential! I found it a little too\u00a0easy just to spam the extending rectangular shape to win. I would love to see this developed further with some balancing tweaks. Well done!"

      "This was a fun platformer! The mechanic of changing your shape and each one having different traits was really nice. I had fun playing thru it and would be interested to see what you cook up if you kept working on the game. Great job!",
      "The shape changing was great with the different shapes having different speed, jump height, and weight. I think respawning at each screen instead of always at the start would have been more fun, but that's a personal preference. Good mechanics, well done!",
      "I've played some of these fast paced die/restart games during this jam and this one is theonlyon that hasn't had a checkpoint system at room swap. The idea here is good and could be iterated upon, but that respawning is rough.",
      "I\u00a0got stuck in the first room. I actually had to watch your video to figure out how to flip the switch -- it wasn't intuitive to me that I'd have to switch shapes to flip it\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085 I tried to jump into the flashing shape but that didn't do anything either.",
      "This is a great concept. I can only think of other puzzles and additions that would make it better. As a prototype, perfect!",
      "I enjoyed playing your game, even though I'm not good at platformers. The idea of transforming into different forms with different qualities seemed fun and interesting to me. Though I didn't immediately understand how to transform - I think adding some control information at the beginning of the game would be good. The music fits the game's pace, and you could add a timer for speedrunners - I think they would enjoy the game first and foremost.",
      "It's a good platformer, but it needs some work. Don't give up and keep developing. I'll wait for the update)",

      "Excellent job! I\u00a0had so much fun with this :)",
      "Such an awesome take on the puzzle platformer genre. One of my favorite entries!",
      "This is one of the best games in this jam. I've never seen a game like this, the idea of switching blocks, but being able to move inside these blocks is amazing. Good Job!",
      "This is so awesome. The concept works so well and the variety shapes can be used for so many different things! In future levels you could even swap some of the shapes for even more possibilities.I'm guessing it's probably to save dev time, but I really liked the \"one big level\" approach which let the player go their own non-linear path. I say keep it like that, you can still have \"levels\" like a normal puzzle game but have each level contain a few coins that you can pick in whatever order you'd like.Only critique I have on the mechanics is that it did feel a bit janky when you were inbetween tiles, one puzzle could be solved by just spamming and hoping it lines up instead of doing the proper approach. But at the same time I like the fluidity of the movement, a grid based one maybe wouldn't feel as good. I guess you could make it so that the player smoothly \"snaps\" when you try to shapeshift, but otherwise have the movement as fluid as it is now.",
      "This was such a cool mechanic! It was fun navigating the levels and trying to get all the coins shifting my block shapes around. I managed to get 9/10 coins, but the one in the top right I couldn't manage to get. Great work on this it's very cool!",
      "This is amazing! Great mechanics, super fun!",
      "Very unique idea and GREAT puzzles. Need more )",
      "Very fun puzzles, and very unique concept for a platformer! I also love the art style, it's simple and cute. The gameplay kinda reminds me of some odd mobile games I would find on the app store. Not a bad thing, though. Gameplay mechanics were implemented beautifully. Not much else to say, you killed it!",
      "Very nice idea!But dat\u00a0 music killing me xD",
      "Very GOOD",
      "this is very well thought and implemented love the idea of fitting shapes to progress through out the levels and the level design is well madei like it alot!no i didnt played this for 10 minutes straight bcs of figuring out what shapes i should use to get a single coin where apparently i only need to use the T shape 2 times to get the coin",
      "very exciting mechanics. I hope to see the sequel!)",
      "The shape changing and face moving mechanics were brilliant and fun! Great game!",
      "Such a unique and interesting game idea! The jump felt really bad though, probably because of the lack of coyote time and because you couldn't even go up 1 tile, making it near useless. Sometimes it felt really hard to line up the shape right, maybe if they're close enough the shapes you turn into automatically snap into a grid so that you don't have to get them perfect. I think this would be really awesome as a metroidvania (metroidbrainia?) type game where you have to find new shapes to access different areas. I also kind of wish there was the ability to move my face without moving the shape (or needing a wall), especially since the WASD keys weren't used at all. Well done!",
      "Very clever. I think the game could benefit from implementing coyote time and jump buffering. That or you could\u00a0remove the ability to jump and make the player rely purely on the shape-shifting and face moving mechanics.",
      "I was actually amazed on how smooth the movement and shape shifting were. A fantastic game overall!",
      "Best game ever",
      "I loved this puzzle game. \u00a0First, great tutorial system. \u00a0Second, clever and original mechanics. \u00a0Easy to learn and fun to play.\u00a0\u00a0This is a winner!",
      "Great game. would love to play more levels weather during or after this jam!\u00a0\u00a0just nailed it...",
      "Very creative idea and some very cool puzzle design. The gaps feel a little bit too tight. I think it is great for a puzzle game, but I get stuck easily trying to move the face, especially when trying to move the face down when I am in T shape. It might be better to make the movement grid-based for the tight puzzle design and avoid the stucking issue. Amazing game - can't wait to see what you make in round 2.",
      "SO fun to play! :D",
      "coool !!!",
      "This one was incredible as expected!\u00a0 Really good use of level design to really highlight your mechanics as well.\u00a0 The one, very nitpicky thing I would say is that there were a few times that I had it figured out but it wasn't letting me shapeshift because I wasn't in quite the right spot.\u00a0 \u00a0A little bit of wiggle room or \"close enough moves into place\" would be nice!\u00a0 All in all great job and a full five stars from me!",
      "The shapeshift feels really satysfying to use since we can move in the form and the puzzles were fun. Can't wait to see even harder one with more shape",
      "Nice spin on the classic platformer. In some cases I found it would be nice if the shape shifting was a little more forgiving, e.g. if it almost fits then just automatically move it to make it fit."

      "Fun little game for the first time, but doesn't really have anything after that. For me the game kept on lagging after not killing anything for a moment and killing one, and it was very easily replicated. The enemies were a bit too simplistic to get any difficulty out of them as they could be circled very easily.",

      "that was very fun.i like the simple concept and i kept playing this for soo longg",
      "The design is simple and effective: while maintaining minimal art, I\u00a0enjoyed the presence of key animations (enemy death, grabbing items), since they make the game modern despite keeping a retro feel.",
      "Cool game!Once I realised I was running out of ammo, I was more conservative with my shooting.The dash mechanic was cool to burst through a horde of enemies!The screen shake got a bit nauseating after a little while, though.Nice job!",
      "I really liked this game! It got repetitive after a while and if you do have ammo I feel it should be displayed somewhere, but that didn't stop me from having a great time. The dash feels really impactful, like you really are unleashing a powerful attack! I ended up getting a score of roughly 300 before I stopped. If you could find a way to make more variation throughout gameplay this could be a really cool game!",
      "Fun game ! Not sure to fully understand why i can't shoot sometimes ? Looks like an ammo limitation.",
      "Great work!",
      "Feel good to play! The audio is simple but adds a lot. I had some horrible lag spikes on web on like every third kill, but on the downloadable version it was fine. I noticed there is some kind of ammo system, cause sometimes I can't shoot, I just wished this ammo was clearly communicated to the player so I knew how to \"save\" it more effectively.",

It's also easy to find a morse translator, but since you have the hex translator, the morse translator should be added in the future.Aside from those nit-picks, this is great!

      "Very nice platformer prototype. The movement feels really fluid and the dashing is very fun to use. I managed to get to the top of the demo world cuz I had to read what that sign said lol. I think some fx on screen, like some speed lines or whatever they're called,\u00a0when you're dashing would be nice, especially to help with pulling off the boost dash mechanic from the ground. Great job on this!",
      "Love your mechanics! The game feels very fluid already. The dash boost mechanic is also neat. This game has a lot of potential to be a great platformer, possibly even a Steam game if you put in the effort.",

      "This is a dope character controller. I\u00a0think it would be a great game! The only thing I would add is that it's hard to tell when I'm dashing. The effect for indicating this could be more noticable.",
      "Unfortunately, I can't get this to play in the browser.\u00a0\u00a0I keep getting this error message: \"WebGL context lost, please reload the page\"",
      "Neat! I like the boost-dash concept. Could benefit from some coyote time, but otherwise well done",
      "Took some practice but I\u00a0was able to get to the end of the tutorial. This was fun and can see this concept going pretty far.",

I'd love to see what else you make. I think it would be awesome if you could choose which two games to combine from a selection.",

      "Man, really difficult, especially this late at night. But a decent concept that was a lot of fun.",
      "I love this concept - I only managed to beat a couple of levels, but the concept is very strong. My main issue was that the game plays very quickly right off the bat; if the earlier levels were slower and the later ones got faster, it would be easier to adjust to. I would like to see this idea developed further. Great job!"

The map could maybe be a bit bigger or like an infinitly generating so that we can still move around as a big reaper but there is so many way this game could continue. Great job!",

      "The actual shooting part of the game was probably the most lacking compared to the rest of the game.

Thank you for adding the checkpoints, if they weren't there I\u00a0might have ragequit because I got caught a lot lol.

The art looks really nice, I think a parallax background would've helped give it a more complete look. The controls took me a bit to get used to, I'm so used to space being dash so I kinda killed myself a lot by accidentally turning into stone. Great work on this!",

It challenged me and I was able to get 54 seconds on the leaderboard. Maybe it was just the leaderboard and I'm just competitive lol.",

Turns out I had to land on top so there was a bit of precision needed there that didn't leave room for error. Great use of mechanics for the puzzles!"

      "Super cool! Very well thought out concept and level! Good job! :D",
      "Very nice 3D\u00a0platformer with quite a big level. I lost the purple ball at some point unfortunately (when you have to hit the big red button). Also I agree with MessMess that the precision platforming on the tiny platforms in the very beginning felt a bit too hardcore, especially given the easier section that comes just after.",
      "Your game is amazing. I liked the platforming, especially near the start area with the sneaky placed hidden star to find. I got quite far and the pull and push mechanics are well implemented. I tried a number of things to get the bouncy ball to the switch but I couldn't figure it out unfortunately so I had to stop at 8 stars. I like the interesting challenges you created and the generous respawn spots definitely helped",
      "Tough game but I love that it doesn't make you do everything again after falling. Simplistic graphics but they work well for the game. The music, animations, and particles all added to the environment and feel of the game very well. Some of the interactions with the boxes and balls could have used more polish even if you cant fix every bug : )",
      "A lot of work went into this one.\u00a0 It's a very tricky platformer, but it did let you restart play quickly after failing.\u00a0 I got stuck attempting to get the very first star, which was hidden below the main plarform.\u00a0 The instructions were well done.",
      "It's flawless. It feels like I'm seeing a game that's already on sale.",
      "Some tough puzzles in there, I had to quit after getting only 5 stars\u00a0because I'm trying to play and rate all the games. I think you did well with the mechanics and it's a fun game. Good work!",
      "I had a lot of fun playing this one! I also really liked the attention to details, like the instructions, cube flipping for double jump or spinning for dash, etc...\u00a0 My main suggestion would be, purely for the sake of getting yourself the best rating you can, try to make it extra clear what you consider your main two mechanics.\u00a0 I assumed platforming and moving the blocks?\u00a0 But I wasn't super sure",
      "Fun playtformer!The way you animate the players movement makes it feel very alive, even without any assets!",
      "I couldn't beat it, but I\u00a0could see the value. Great job, wonderful prototype",
      "Absolutely loved the first few moments and then got to the sprint double-jump combo and after six failed attempts, I had enough.\u00a0 It's probably easier for others, but I'm not sure why it's so challenging right at the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0Great looking game, that I would like to play more of, but I would need an easier mode.",
      "LOVED THE GAME! very fun, i think its lacking sprites, art and models, but i get its hard in the 14 day time limit, the captions were very funny, love this game an dam excited to see what you do with it (if you end up doing something with it)",
      "I liked the game! I just found a bit, robotic the movements, but otherwise, this is great!",
      "Very fun game, good puzzle platformer with simple but still interesting mechanics! Loved the entry, good job!",
      "Fun time mastering the attract/repel mechanic. I only had to die 32 times :)",
      "Very fun game - I did accidently lose the cube you had to step on - but otherwise great.",
      "Really awesome 3D platformer! very nice, fast and snappy physics, and good platforming challenges. great level design overall. Nice!",
      "I loved this game. I love 3d platformers and platformers in general so this was great. The movement felt tight and there were a good number of mechanic with the dash and double jump and different obstacles to get around. I think I cheated a bit cuz I was able to get ontop of the wall and completely bypass the section where you're supposed to launch a box into the switch. My only complaint is that the game made me stop playing when I got the flag, and that's when I noticed I only got 9/10 stars. I would've loved to go back and find that last star. Really great job on this I had so much fun playing it.",
      "The yellow box got lost in walls :("

      "Good job! It would be cool if the weapons did different things. Cause rn the knife is kinda useless once u get the gun. Otherwise good job! ;D",
      "A really solid start! The guns seem objectively better than the any relevant melee options, but that doesn't mean the knives aren't still fun. The game started to really slow down at wave 7-8, so I would like to maybe see more zombies spawn the quicker you kill them. because I was waiting for the next spawn interval more often than I was killing zombies. Solid across the board.",
      "Amazing game! Couldn't figure out how to equip the guns after I bought them, though, and they didn't appear in my inventory. But overall, solid entry, the combat is fun and challenging, and I would love to see the game fleshed out. I just wish I could've gotten to experience what the guns are like."

      "Simple and but fun mechanics. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to seeing where this goes. This has so much potential for future rounds.",
      "This is such a great idea! A lot of potential to explore with the 10 seconds, good Job. I definetly want to see you continue this game, because this can become a really nice puzzle game.As some others already stated, the blocks jitter a bit when moving with time, but thats not a big problem.",
      "\"Timmy the timer got taped to a time bomb\" is hilarious opening but also\u00a0sounded very promissing and\u00a0I\u00a0was sad that this angle wasn't exploited much (for example, when time runs out Timmy just get's knocked down but doesn't explode as promised). The gameplay is nice, I'd get annoyed at games that reset every death but repeating the learned maneuvers was fun here so I managed to beat it after ~10 tries. Player's walk animation is adorable.",
      "It was extremely short but the mechanic were all there. Now just add more levels, maybe some enemies and you got yourself an interesting indie game. The art was simple enough to probably be able to produce them fast for a multitude of levels.",
      "I need tos ee this game in round 2 with more polish and stuff, great stuff hazmatt your games are always good!!",
      "This is awesome. I really like the pause and rewind mechanics. Would love to play more of this and see what other ideas you could cook up for challenges or puzzles with the mechanics. I think a bit of a tutorial would've been good, took me a second to figure out what to do, but wasn't too bad once I read thru the instructions on the page lol. Great work!",
      "That was awesome! I love the time control mechanic, there is so much potential with only have 10 seconds where all the level's objects are doing specific things on the timeline. Very very cool.I would say some really brief demonstration of the mechanic at the beginning (like a tutorial but just like... a 2 second animation or something demonstrating rather than a description tutorial) that would be cool. Also, if you can get the objects to move more smoothly through time, that would be nice. there's a little choppyness to their movement i noticed.As for the core and secondary mechanics, they're brilliant ideas. Keep going with it!",
      "I really like the platforming mechanics with the wall jump mix with the time manipulation mechanics. I think you nailed the prompt and all the judging criteria and want to see more of this game. Well done!",
      "awesome concept!would love to see this developed furthertook a while for me to get the hang of\u00a0the mechanics but its pretty easy to understand reallyloved it! nice work man!yo can you make this work in real lifei need to reverse time so i can prevent myself eating that one chili the other day",
      "I can't wait till the rest of the story, I need to know\u00a0what happened to Timmy the Timer!",
      "I'm not great at platformers and I was especially terrible at this one.\u00a0\u00a0I wish it started easier.\u00a0\u00a0I like the idea of it, but I could hardly progress with my skill level.",
      "This is a great idea, honestly love the time manipulation stuff like this! The time being on the character made it easy to see how close I was to losing. If I could rewind 10 seconds, I would write this review again!",
      "Love this game! It took me a second to understand the time warping but once I\u00a0got it under control, it was fun!",
      "Super cool concept",

      "This is a really cool idea. I love automation games so it was fun to get some automata working for me. It'd be nice if you could see what materials you needed for stuff in the shop menu too, cuz I found myself going back and forth a lot to figure out what to craft for profit. I ended up just making a ton of heads over time to make money.

Great job on this I had fun playing it!",

      "Hi there!First of all, congratulations on submitting for GDKO 2025!Your game doesn't seem to have any direction towards progression.\u00a0I felt like I was clicking buttons and hearing noises without ever seeing anything to show for it.The minigame was brilliant, albeit a little bit janky to move around, but still a great premise!The sound clips were very high in reverb, which would work well with a backing track of music, but by themselves it definitely made the game feel even more empty.The art style is great, and\u00a0would work even better\u00a0if the 3D models were implemented.Thanks!"

      "This game was cool, very solid platformer. I like the different difficulties, I ended up playing thru on easy I think. I laughed really hard that baby mode makes a crying baby sound play in the background. Impossible mode seems truly impossible lol. I would've liked the camera to be pulled back a bit to help with some of the blind jumps that were far away or far below the character while I was going for them.\u00a0Great work on this!",
      "you did a good level design",

      "I love this game. The art style is absolute bananas and I am in love with it. I had to play it as soon as I saw the insane looking cover image. I was streaming myself playing it and the people in chat couldn't stop saying how cool this game was and how awesome the music was. I haven't finished it quite yet, need to go back tomorrow and beat it. But I made it a bit past the door boss. One frustrating thing that happened was I was using the mouse to move and I think the game continues moving after a fight based on your last mouse movement maybe? But as soon as I beat the door boss my character walked into the door and right back down so I had to fight it again. I don't think I clicked anywhere after fighting the boss, but maybe I did idk. Really awesome work on this game it is so so cool, one of my favs from the jam so far.",

      "I like your sense of humor and you have a good sense of how big things should be on the screen. I think the gameplay could use a bit more spice, like some kind of second or third thing that happens which might distract you from the farming of moonshine etc. , to maybe expand the management a little, or crank up the challenge a little. But it's a fun idea and I hope you keep going with it.the V.O. was funny, you should lean into that, consider doing more characters but doing them all yourself (like a hand puppet conversation vibe).nice work overall!",
      "I'm not from your country so\u00a0I couldn't really understand the references, like what do these items have to do with the story, and so, now and then, I would have a \"Wait, is this racist?\" moment. I hope it's not, because I'm good at this game, probably the best on the planet and if it's made by aliens to find the chosen one I am to be contacted any minute now.",
      "So I think the mechanics are purchasing then feeding propaganda to the politician, in that I think you did great and I liked how creepy it was. Would have liked to see more in the way of results, when I played it went to the politician in shadow then back to the title screen. Otherwise, well done, I could see some potential in this, I want to see you take it further. Good work!",

      "- Tabbing without the \"interaction\" area close by breaks the mouse as it doesn't release and movement stops or keeps going on its own- The menu at the start isVERYdifficult to see, as I had to look at the video to figure out where it was- General bad FPS, but that is to be expected from UE5- Transitioning to the other level completely bricked the controls but the game didn't crash- Couldn't really figure out what the spells were supposed to be as there were four different direction keys to be used- Development build, that's it.Interesting idea that could probably be developed further, but currently it is very bare bones.",
      "Its a very nice looking game! I know you mentioned before that these are premade assets, but it comes together nice. I will say though that I think some more work should be put into the \"game loop\" as far as how the player can understand it. The game kinda tells you what to do in a little text box for a few seconds, but as a player I didnt really know how that should work. Eventually I sussed it out, but after that I still didnt know what the objective was. Eventually I found the enemies outside I could beat, but that seemed to be it. We arent required to make a full game, but it would be good to give the player a hint of progression a bit more"

      "Bow FPS reminds me of all my stealth archer builds in Skyrim. Great game and nice touch on particle effects\u00a0for upgrades!",
      "One of the potentials imo! Really like to see this turned into a full game! :DLooking forward to it!",
      "I like what's here so far. Character feels a little floaty and controls could be tighter. Upgrade system opens up a lot of possibilities for different playstyles.",
      "great game realy love it",
      "I liked the game! I thought the movement was slow, and I didn't know whether the enemies did anything, maybe they weren't meant to, but anyway, pretty good game!",
      "been waiting to rate thisvery well thought and executed both core and secondary really fits wellwould love to see this to be developed furtherwell done man!",
      "Archery is always fun ! Your implementation works really well",
      "Love the shooting, bow model is beautiful, i think the player movement could be faster but that just might me being critical as i aint very keen on first person games, but this is great and good luck in round 2 if you make it!",
      "I think you have a really good game here that fits the task and judging criteria perfectly. Well done!",
      "So.. you hit the two mechanics with a gold arrow.",
      "Really fun, sad it was so short really liked the flame arrow wish more of that will be implemented. For the task at hand really good and im looking forward to the next update :)",
      "The shooting really felt awesome and the player movement was really clean. Graphically looked awesome as well, all the fire effects were wicked. Really enjoyable and looking forward to seeing where you take this in the next round (assuming you continue with this idea)",
      "Shooting feels great and I really like how the skill tree looks with the runes now! After playing through it again now, I think I know why some people get overrun by enemies while others don't: you don't know where the enemies are coming from, so if you are simply looking another way you will get back stabbed, and it will feel more difficult.",
      "Very nice one!\u00a0Love how the targets in the enemies pretty much beg for you to shoot them! Really effective messaging. Also great visuals and atmosphere!\u00a0(One small bug is that you can spend currency in already bought upgrades.)",
      "Very nice feeling bow mechanic! I imagine that took a lot of time to tweak, the arrow flight time and everything feels really great.",
      "S tier for sure. Very nice game!",
      "I really liked the feel and visuals of the bow. Nice work!",
      "Very cool game, remembered me of the Kovaak's days. Fire arrows were the best option for an ability btw",
      "I liked this game. Fire ability is great, love how the VFX of butning enemies look, lol",
      "fun game with nice art. i would like to see this game idea developed further",
      "The mechanics are nice and simple, and the shooting feels great. This game has a lot of potential, and I'm excited to see its future development",
      "Very nice submission, looks promising. I got spooked by those enemies. The outline shader effect looks stylish. I like the bow drawing animation. It would be cool if firing had a bit of animation too. Also, aren't bows meant to be held straight? I guess this is the gangsta/drive-by version of bow holding. If you continue to work on it, more interaction of the elements with the environment could be cool. Also, I shot an arrow straight up in the air and it hit me but it didn't hurt me.",
      "This was fantastic! \u00a0Easily one of my favorites.\u00a0\u00a0Loved the mechanics. \u00a0Shooting the arrows felt great and that is an awesome start to the skill tree.\u00a0\u00a0I just need shift to let me run and then you need a lot more levels!\u00a0 This is a winner and I hope you keep working on it.",
      "I had a lot of fun, and regret not being able to try out the last two runes. My biggest complaint would be that I sometimes felt like I hit the targets in the bullseye, but they did not disappear.",
      "Despite the game not being finished it is really well put together. the runes make for a really cool and different way to implement the secondary mechanic and for progression. Id love to see how this game will come out in the futur",
      "I like what you made, having some sound effects and some background music could have been a nice addition.Nice ending where you had to [REDACTED]",
      "Cool game ! Hope to see more of it in the next rounds.",
      "Was fun to play on stream.\u00a0\u00a0Appreciate you stopping by.",
      "This game looks great. I liked how arrows would stick to enemies if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit the target. I agree that a little audio would had helped. I assume the reticle for the arrow tensing shows how far the arrow will go? I had some trouble estimating volley trajectories not sure if there could be some visual feedback (maybe locked behind an upgrade).",
      "this was entertaining. i enjoyed the precision reticle and the classy environment was not lost on me. i believe any kind of audio feedback would go a long way, not just for playability but to accentuate the core and secondary mechanics that, otherwise, were so sturdily implemented. also, i thought\u00a0a cool feature to come would be allowing fire arrows to set terrain ablaze and ignite enemies that pass through. i hope you had fun making it :)",
      "Very fun game! I\u00a0got stuck when I\u00a0had to find the exit, so I may not have looked hard enough lol.",
      "I liked the mechanics and the upgrade system. My only complaint(not sure if i missed out on any settings) is the mouse sensitivity. Hope you expand on it!",
      "CLEAN! Mechanics felt polished. I enjoyed the shooting arrows and upgrades felt very good.\u00a0 With such a stable mechanics you could make a proper game out of it.\u00a0 I hope you will keep working on this project.",
      "This has made such huge progress from what I saw earlier in development! Really enjoyed the mechanics, and would really love to see this developed further!",
      "This was awesome. I loved the upgrade tree and getting the fire arrows, really wish I could've gotten that AOE upgrade. I also really like the art and the fire effect\u00a0 A lot of potential in this one I hope you keep working on it! Great work!",
      "Definitely huge potential with these mechanics! I would love to see your game evolve into a full RPG.Well done!",
      "nice game bro, i loved it",
      "I remember testing this out earlier: great potential here and would love to see where you take this!"

      "Took me a lot of tries to get used to the game. Maybe start off a little slower and have the belt slowly speed up to let the player get a chance to see what's going on and experiment a little. Other than that, I think the game has a lot of potential for future development.",
      "Cool concept, and a good start which can be expanded on!",
      "Very cool concept took me a second to get used to the fact the mouse wasn't lined up with the chopsticks but the sensitivity helped a lot.",
      "It's hard!\u00a0Like real chopsticks! ) Very fun idea )",
      "Well done submitting!I struggled a bit to understand exactly what\u00a0I had to do in the beginning, but picked it up after a few plays. The movement of the items seems fixed in\u00a0acceleration, which made it difficult to hone in on the sushi. And the learning curve is much too fast to begin with. Slowing the train down drastically in the beginning would give the player a chance to grasp the mechanic, before then speeding it up over time.Definitely has potential, I hope to see more projects in the future!",
      "I liked the mechanics, it was challenging but fun.\u00a0 Though I did have trouble with aiming, and it could use some sounds,\u00a0it was a pretty good game!",
      "Hello! Was a bit of a challenge for me. But when I understood the task it was quite a fun. Aiming felt a bit weird, because at first I wanted to grab objects with chopsticks. Some sounds and background music would add a lot for this game. I liked it!",
      "Cool concept, it took me a while to understand that I was losing (didn't notice the plate straight up) but it was very fun after I fully understood it",
      "Great entry, thanks for submitting it.",
      "Hey I figured the primary mechanic is drag and drop and the progression is to meet the quota, but what is the secondary mechanic\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u00ab"

      "nice survival game candified",
      "Very fun and very clever game !",
      "One of my favorite games so far.\u00a0\u00a0The mechanics all worked smoothly and the upgrades were fun. \u00a0Really well implemented game. \u00a0Very fun!",
      "Cool game! It reminds me of that old mobile game where you squish the bugs as they run across the screen... Throwing the ants was a blast",
      "Loved the game its really good!, used the throw alot and the punches for straglers but otherwise really addicting",
      "Really good game! I really enjoyed it but i think it should be more obvious when youve grabbed something but apart from that i really enjoyed it",
      "ah yes killing bugs my cat would love thisreally liked the game would play this when im with ma cat aroundvery well executed, nice work man!",
      "Super fun and addicting game!\u00a0My only advice would be that some of the upgrades didn't feel as impactful as\u00a0I would have liked, for example lvl 4 damage increase still took 2 hits to kill a basic ant, the same amount at lvl 0, and 3 hits for one of the stronger ones which I think was the same for like level 1 or 2. I would love to see how it's expanded upon, like more unique upgrades that have cool synergies for example or puzzles and new methods of combat with the two core mechanics here.\u00a0Also as a pretty small nitpick punching the candy felt\u00a0 very punishing which led to me avoiding the punch radius mechanics, maybe it could be lessened or the upgrade that protects against ant or hold damage would also help for punches. Overall I had a great time, nice job!",
      "I love how incredibly large the radius is on the lv5 punch area upgrade now. Good stuff! I could get like 7 ants in one punch",
      "WOW you did sooo well! Love the ant at the end xD",
      "This is a game genre that I didn't know I needed! I love all the different upgrades and how they have the ability to generate a completely different play-style. The art really adds to the feel of the game in a great way! Overall a fantastic game, look forward to what else you have in store!",
      "Incredible! So so fun, so intuitive and easy to pick up, wonderful graphical and audio feedback. I am very very much into this game. Well done",
      "S-tier submission. Super addictive.",
      "Nice and cute little game. I liked it!",
      "nice game bro i loved it",
      "LOOOOVE the effects!",
      "Really lovely little game! would love to see this worked out even more than it already is",
      "Great game, I'm already stuck in it :)",
      "Great graphics and a great concept well executed. I\u00a0can see a ton of potential in this idea.",
      "Holy crap I love it so much!! Do you have any plans on expanding this???",
      "Arrggghhhh ! the ants! Who gave the ants shields!!!???",
      "Great game! Really enjoyed this, and loved the art!",
      "Perfect job and very good choice as game style for this task. Smooth gameplay and cute visuals.",
      "Fun and intuitive game. It fits the theme beautifully and and has great music and art design. Great job!",
      "Before playing it, I thought it was a familiar genre, but it actually showed creativity.",
      "All this violence paired with suchSWEETmusic!",
      "This is a really fun game and very easy to understand. One of the best I've played so far",
      "Super fun game I found out I really enjoy killing ants.",
      "Lots of fun!",
      "So addictive and fun - my favourite game in the jam!",
      "I love ants so killing so many of them hurt my soul, but otherwise very well done game!\u00a0Good pixel art, animations and mechanics, you're going to go far this way.",
      "Even though I enjoyed the gameplay, the idea seemed strange to me (I mean having to protect candy from ants).",
      "Very fun game! It was so satisfying once I\u00a0got my attack high enough to one shot the ants without shields. I didn't really mess with the throw mechanic at all, but the punching was very fun. I\u00a0managed to win on my 2nd run. Great work on this!",
      "10/10 protected my candy but tastes like ants",
      "Nice simple game. The upgrades could use a bit of balancing work since there's no real need to choose between them.",
      "Very polished title. Good Job! The 2 mechanics work so well, and complement each other great."

      "Fun concept, cool game! It was nice to play but I couldn't figure out how to pass the level with 2 bulls and 2 woods :(",
      "Very cool puzzle game. I liked the crafting system a lot. I accidentally played thru the beginning so fast that the narration assumed I'd played the game before and stopped lol. Took me a little bit to figure out how some stuff worked, like the box being able to store items, but I got thru the whole game in the end. Great work on this!",
      "Props for being the first game I've run into this jam to have narration. The art style was interesting and audio was good. The crafting mechanic and certain puzzles were quite unclear at first but cleared up fast.",
      "Clever puzzle game. \u00a0I'm impressed with how much you got in here in two weeks. \u00a0 I think with a little more time this could be great.\u00a0\u00a0Would love to have some music and sounds (my game needs both too).\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck with it.",
      "Wow! I really like the voice over and how it react with how we play. The puzzle were interactif and fun, I look forward to see it in futur rounds",
      "This concept is great. I kinda wish that the already discovered crafting recipes were visible somewhere, but since this is just round one, thats no problem.\u00a0The tutorial was a nice addition",
      "Wow loved this one !\u00a0 I like the spoken tutorial and the mechanics are simple but fun to play with. Took me some time to see the \"press R to restart\" in top right corner.",
      "Great puzzle game !\u00a0Very fun narration, it added a lot to the game )",
      "Nice voice over! I was not expecting that. I missed the voice over when I finished the tutorial. You could do a lot of cool things with the voice-over.",
      "I love this game. Probably one of my favorites I have played so far. The voice-over is funny and gives me a Stanley Parable vibe. The mouth sound SFX and chill music fit the game very well. The mechanics are very creative. If you decide to expand this in the future round, you have a very solid base.Great job!",
      "Loved the narration that really brings you into the game. The puzzles fit really well with the mechanic to make you think about making the proper choices and the proper times. Wonderful",
      "Really loved your game! The Hidden Folks inspired sound design will forever be charming. The minimalist art style compliments the puzzles really well. Very easy to pick up, and can be made much more difficult if required.Well done!",
      "Very fun! The replay easter egg is hilarious and the puzzles felt playfully designed in a way that was amusing but still made me feel clever for finishing.\u00a0 Wonderful job!",
      "I like the art of the game, it's made very cool, it's interesting to see more of these games. It took me a long time to figure out how all the controls worked, but when I did, it was very interesting)",
      "The game itself is a really well executed puzzle game, every level brings something new here and everything just works so well. I really liked playing it!\u00a0The narrating is amazing as well,\u00a0very fun, 10/10. I'm a little worried about the narrator tho, you might want to check if they got murdered or smth since they never came back to us.",
      "Really fun puzzle game! I liked mixing the items to see what they could make, only wish I could have understood that all of them were a little better, I did a lot of trial and error.",
      "That was super fun :)I got run over by the bulls more than once :D .. I hope you make more levels at some point :)",
      "Well that was a really wholesome and nice experience! thankyou.",

      "Soo cool! It's a good idea and a great rage game :)",
      "Great rage game :) To keep my sanity I had to find another way to beat it. I ended up pushing into the left wall, waiting to be pushed out and then jumping and pushing left again to get on top of the next block in the wall, and climbing up all the way like that.",
      "Very fun, but very tricky! I do think it's a little slippery, but thatdoesadd to the challenge of it. More levels in the future could be very fun to see.",
      "Very cool idea :)",
      "I liked the mechanics a lot. I feel like they could use a bit more visual feedback (the bars are helpful but aren't particularly fun to look at, versus more elaborate player animation). However, your level building was great and progressed in difficulty the perfect amount. I enjoyed the tough deceleration and heavy feel of the droid. Very solid entry!",
      "",
      "Tough but fun to play - nice one. You definitely succeeded with your aim of inducing rage, but also satisfaction ;)",
      "Wish I could slow down a bit better :D I did notice a small bug that can be exploited, you can climb the big wall on the left to go all the way up, as the character clips on the \"floor\" of each wall block, allowing you to jump out of the block to the one above, if you wiggle at the right moment",
      "Tough game because of how much the bot slid. The jump and hover mechanics were great and it was fun getting to the door at the top.",
      "This is another game that was really fun, but I was terrible at it.\u00a0\u00a0I really liked the mechanics and how the jump and hover could work together. \u00a0Also, not a big thing, but I love the robot logo on your start screen.\u00a0 Really well done game!",
      "I liked it, however, I fell down on the last jump",
      "Got pretty far with my first try but had to rage quit after falling all the way down :') The hovering is just right amoung ot annoying, good level design also. Well done.",
      "I really enjoyed playing thru this game. It does a good job of being a rage game without being crazy frustrating thanks to the hover mechanic. I think the controls are a bit slippery in terms of turning around or slowing yourself down when coming down from a hover, but maybe that's by design for the rage game. Great job on this it's a lot of fun!",
      "Really fun, also not much of a rage game since the boosters give you a sense of control yet it keeps it hard. Solid execution!",
      "Great mechanic, I see the potential to induce rage among those who progress far and have to restart (me included), but the sense of accomplishment is satisfying.",
      "Cool mechanic. Allows for traversal and there are lots of opportunities to allow for even more progression via upgrades and stuff. It's tough! I got to the 3rd elevator platform a few times but just kept falling off :DWell done!",
      "Great game overall! Didn't get very far, but it didn't take that much to see the potential. Gameplay feels good for the most part,\u00a0but you need to spare a bit of patience. Not much else to say, keep up the good work!",
      "Hover was really tricky, but the resultant rage upon messing up made for a great sense of progression :)"

Pretty much the most successful take on the theme that I've seen\u00a0so far, I don't even know why it just feels that way. One issue is, I'm pretty sure I was able to use all the colors before learning them, which I shouldn't be able to if I understood the game's planned constraints. Still, that didn't hinder the awe of it.",
      "I had fun playing. My biggest complaint is that there is no penalty for entering the incorrect direction, which makes spamming keys effective",
      "I got the promotion \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b3\u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b3I ended up on 105 boxes with the best day being 19! I really enjoyed the 'aha' moment when i realised that the boxes you learn always have the same pattern..... though i sucked at remembering them.",
      "Great little game! Addictive and fun.\u00a0 Well done!"

      "Cool game idea. I love the freeze to heal mechanic with high risk to reward. I would love to see this game built on in the futer.",
      "I really like the Idea, huge fan of mechanics with high reward/risk so the freeze for heal was fun. Would absolutly love see this getting continued into a full game",
      "The mechanics, shooting and healing worked pretty well together. Deciding when to freeze and for how long in order to heal is a novel idea. I\u00a0think the game has a lot of potential. I think it could use a bit of polish as well to make things run smoother to better demonstrate the mechanics you implemented. But it's a good start.",
      "After retrying the game it decided to work, no clue what has changed since the latest update is from before trying to play it, oh well. It was rather bare bones and the enemies kept getting stuck as their pathfinding is probably just move towards the player. Also the player could go into negative integers and it wasn't some one off as it happened every time. The trees also were so large they blocked the enemies and the player's movement.",
      "I like the secondary mechanic. The inability to move is a huge risk but it can pay off if you get enough healing. Could be fun to expand :)",
      "pretty cool concept attack as the core and heals you but freezes you as the \"payment\" to get your self healednice work man!",
      "This is a great prototype. I can't seem to get the healing/freezing (assuming this is the 2nd mechanic) otherwise, fun to play!",
      "The game is borked, may or may not be your fault as it tries to access some raytracing.cpp function that doesn't exist."

      "5 stars for difficulty (lol).",
      "Loved the puzzle! I\u00a0was very confused but when\u00a0I looked at the hints I kind of understood? Still not really sure lol, I\u00a0couldn't really solve any by myself.\u00a0 I agree with the other feedback about the difficulty progression, some easier ones at the beginning would be great!\u00a0The puzzle in the menu was really good and a good start to the\u00a0game!",
      "I love puzzle games and thought I would love this, but it's just so hard and cryptic, right from the start.\u00a0\u00a0I think you really need to start easier and let us learn and get better as we go. \u00a0Or it might just be that\u00a0I am dumb. :)",
      "I would love to see more of this game!\u00a0 As others have mentioned it definitely has a steep learning curve and was pretty confusing to get started with, but I think it has a LOT of potential.",
      "Wow I\u00a0really like your core mechanic, lots of potential to build off of it! I will admit, the puzzles had me confused in general: I liked the main menu as a sort of \"puzzle\" and think that one worked well, but once in the game itself I think it could use a little more guidance to help the player get on the right track with solving puzzles.",
      "I really like the idea of this game!I have to admit that I struggled a bit and could never do it without Solution \u00f0\u009f\u0098Also the\u00a0 Sounds of the Flute could be a little louder.Hope this gets developed further!",
      "The game was cool once I figured it out, but I had no idea what things meant at first. I thought there were something wrong in the main menu, it would be nice to get some feedback when you make inputs.",
      "Very clever idea. I especially liked how the start menu itself is a puzzle. The only thing missing is some form of feedback so the player knows when they did something right.",
      "I think probably I'm just too dumb to play this type of game. I managed to get some doors open but through sheer luck of randomly pressing keys to get the right code. No idea how you would work them out haha. All the same pretty cool, and I'd like to have another go at some point.",
      "LOOOOOVE this type of game.",
      "Really liked this game. I\u00a0also liked not being given much and having to figure it out. I couldn't open a few of the doors, but I\u00a0found a glowing thing that said \"under construction.\" Great game, one of my favorites from this round.",
      "I dig this game - it took a while to understand the controls but once I did it was a pretty cool puzzle game! I'm convinced one of the doors is impossible to beat, and I ran into a second door where I think the texture that shows the pattern to open it was missing.",
      "I managed to get a few of the doors open. \u00a0But I could never really figure out the pattern to the doors.",

      "Very clever. I hope you decide to continue. You have a very good sense of pacing in your story telling however brief :)",
      "Interesting mechanic to disable and enable different components, but how it was told probably should've used a bit more time in the oven. The graphics were simple but it fit with the rest of the game well.",

      "Really cool game. I wish there were more levels.",
      "Great cannon game, the placeable end location gave it a bit of extra fun.",
      "This was great! addicting and fun. I beat the first level without even putting the door down. lol \u00a0 I would love to see this made into something bigger!",
      "Such a great job man! Well done! Very fun game",
      "I feel the design is well defined, and as I stated in another review for a different entry, I\u00a0really enjoy when level-based games keep introducing new mechanics as the game goes on (like you did with portals!)",
      "Very clever idea\u00a0! Have a lot of fun (and a little frustration\u00a0:) with puzzles!",
      "This is a very polished game. Very challenging and i love how it incorporates the theme... It was short but very polished. I love the idea of puzzling but with a sling shot and portals! , makes it cool",
      "Very cool game. I like the blueprint- construction art style. The mechanics are creative. It feels great that many levels can have multiple solutions since you can choose where the door should be. Great job!",
      "Love the mechanics, and the graphics. In particular, graphics has something special about it, like an actual art direction. The only bothersome thing is that I have to position the door on each restart, would be better if they stayed where you left them and relocation was optional.\u00a0Level 7 was too much for my brain, sadly I had to resign there. But really great work, and game does have potential.",
      "Level design/progression is good since it gives you some freedom to figure out the puzzles.\u00a0Aiming is also\u00a0well-done, I like how the ball speed depends on the click\u00a0distance.\u00a0Reminds me of some older\u00a0Android games, I believe there are a lot of extra\u00a0mechanics left to add if wanted.",
      "The score / time moving really hurt my brains when I tried to calculate how to shoot. Also I apparently missed the balls velocity being tied to the mouse position, so I tried to spam the ball in totally stupid spots. The door being stationary probably could've opened up the game for another mechanic. Interesting concept and art style, could develop further into a full scale indie game.",
      "Game is the good. I will eat that ball. (This is not a review I am just being goofy because the dev is a friend)",
      "Was a fun game (completed all the levels) and the door placing game a bit more freedom when trying to find a solution, would suggest modifying where you can put the door as currently you can just put the door on top of the last star you'll collect making the best solution often just slapping it on top off a star.",
      "Hey, cool game, nice unique concept and good puzzle design! I beat the whole thing and it was not easy lol. I had the ball go into freakout mode a couple times, maybe you can add a max speed to the ball so it can never go out of control?But regardless, I had fun. Nice work!P.S. I loved the idea of choosing where to put the door. I think that's so cool. I say stick with this one!",
      "Great game!The click and drag wasnt always responsive at times, but otherwise the levels and the physics all worked wonderfully! Could easily be expanded into a bigger game!",
      "I absolutely love this concept!!!! I will come back when the voting beigns.",
      "This was a really nicely presented and fun puzzle game. I think the mechanics worked well together and you did a great job of slowly inbtroducing concepts to the player and exploring differnt ideas as the levels progressed. The tutorial text was clear and helpful.\u00a0I thought the actual mechanics were well implemented and everything, at least on my playthrough, worked really well. I saw you put quite a few times about the 'Wonky physics' but i wouldnt worry too much about it, I think people expect some oddities with physics based games and its part of the charm!I found it a little unintuative that the distance of the mouse controlled the power. My muscle memory kept taking over and assuming that it was how long i help the mouse down for, so id just have to watch the ball pathetically dribble away out the cannon at no speed quite a lot \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b2.\u00a0 That is on me though i think. However, i really would love to be able to just re-shoot without replacing the door! especially when i kept messing up.",
      "Super fun! Unique game, with polished mechanics. I do agree with what others have said about adding some sort of visual indication of the power. Well done, such a great entry!!",
      "This was fun, a really solid puzzle game and I especially liked the portal mechanic. It'd be nice if there was some indicator of how far you were going to shoot the ball. Great job on this I had fun playing thru it!",
      "A game about a bouncing ball, that's my jam! It works well, and the art looks nice. I found the controls for moving the door a bit odd; it would be easier if you could just drag it.",
      "I love this kind of puzzle game - lots of fun to play.\u00a0 I did think the levels got harder a bit too quickly, but that is an easy thing to fix after the jam.\u00a0\u00a0This is great (a favorite of mine) and I hope you get to keep working on it.",
      "The mechanics were layered very well on top of each other. It really felt like there was a solid progression throughout the game. Great job!",
      "Fun game! Ive left my feedback in the community post.",
      "its nice game. I had fun playing it.",
      "made me rage. was very fun though, very well made and i really like the art!",
      "Fun playing on stream.\u00a0 Appreciate you stopping by.",
      "Nice work, well aligned with the task.",
      "Great game!The mechanics compliment each other very well.Allowing the player to move the door is a very nice touch; makes it feel more interactive and immersive!Well done!",
      "YOU COOKEDThis is actually so insanely well done, crazy you made this in 2 weeks.I wanna see more!(Really small UI suggestion, maybe have an arrow that shrinks/scales with the mouse distance away from the cannon, so it becomes really obvious how much power the ball will shoot out with)",
      "I really like this game, well done!",
      "This is a great game, had me hooked from the start! There's a bit of a game breaking bug on lvl 9 where you can shoot at\u00a0the wall and it phases through to the other cannon, but I love this idea"

      "This is really neat! I hope you continue to work on it. You could have a very interesting tactical sim type game here :)",
      "I can really see how much time you spent on this o.o, I hope that you can achieve your full vision if you continue to work on it!",
      "A very impressive and sophisticated turn based battling system! Super fun and pretty well-balanced. Had a blast playing. Great job!",
      "Great to see your work again Keltfire! Great work on this one, solid gameplay with many options to adapt your strategy! The tooltips were very helpful especially how to cancel an attack, and how much damage things did. Very promising!",
      "",
      "Very nice strategy game. I liked the amount of different abilities that i could use. Well done!",
      "This game is awesome. I love the strategy of it and it's very fun to hit a big group of enemies with a juicy fireball shot. Could definitely see this being expanded upon with more enemies and cards and levels. I made it to wave 27 with 167 kills. Great job on this it was a lot of fun!",
      "I don't play these types of games that often, but this one was fantastic. Well done! Love to see more :D",
      "I liked this a lot - I really enjoy turn based combat. \u00a0Nice use of the mechanics.\u00a0 I wish the tutorial was interactive.\u00a0\u00a0But, even without the game was fun to play. \u00a0Well done.",
      "Good battle game with a nice strategy angle. I think you covered the task very well and made something interesting and fun.",
      "Love this idea and I would play a lot more but.... currently at work lol. Love the mechanics and getting to choose which upgrade to get each round! Would love to see how you progress this!!!",
      "Was a ton of fun playing this on stream.\u00a0 Felt like a cool mix of like Runescape and Civilization\u00a0(which sounds strange, but totally works).",
      "I like this game! I think it works just right mechanically to keep me going for the next rounds! Each new ability makes me want more haha If you have time to make anymore tweaks (or taking suggestions for round 2), could i suggest a little bit of wait time between ending your turn and seeing the effects of the enemy's turn? I like that the enemy's turn doesnt take up time, but the effects of their turn happen like maybe even before the game displays that its their turn"

      "This is a pretty cool concept. I like the controls and it feels good when you manage to survive a section. Like others have mentioned some of the spikes were impossible to avoid the first time, which seemed unfair. You could also get caught on the edge of some of the doors that closed. The music restarting each run is quite unpleasant. I expected the music to loop, especially since a game can be over very quickly.",
      "I really love gravity changes.\u00a0 I actually almost used it, too!\u00a0 My only note would be that some of the levels had you run into spikes so fast that you almost had to know what the room would be like to progress.",
      "Love it, has a good rage/ addiction as you want to make it to the next screen! lol When you get to the blue level are you supposed to beat the doors before they close?",
      "I like gravity switching games and I like some tough games. It was a fun, but dying because the guy hit something off screen is not the best way to make a game difficult. I think the concept can be taken much further and hope to see you make it better (I'll still play the games if I don't make it).",
      "Very cool!",
      "Like the primary mechanic, did not get the secondary mechanic. But fun game. I wish it had checkpoints because my slow brain struggled a lot. But fun game nevertheless!",
      "I thought this was really clever and fun. \u00a0I just had trouble playing it because the character slides so fast and my reaction times are so slow. \u00a0I wish there was an option (settings or a button) that made him slide slower.\u00a0 Still, this was a very good puzzle game with strong mechanics.",
      "I thought this was an interesting game - the gravity switching was a cool mechanic, although the secondary mechanic of the mechanic helper was a little passive. It would have been nice to be able to directly activate the helper so you have more control on removing barriers. I think this would be a cool game to develop further!"

      "I absolutely loved this game! \u00a0Dice rolling is my jam (see my game). \u00a0This was so much fun.\u00a0\u00a0I just want more. \u00a0Perfect score!",
      "I completed this but the bandoleer came in clutch cause i made some _poor_ choiced before.",
      "Really great potential. Here are some things to point out:",
      "Umm what a great game!! I've been wanting to make a game with dice exactly how you did in this game!! Such a great idea and use of the mechanics! Are you planning on expanding, and if so what do you want to do???",
      "I haven't see this concept before. This for sure has some potential. Good!",
      "Very nice demo! I felt like it was pretty easy to survive though, so it could use some balancing to make it more challenging.",
      "I like the distribution of the dice numbers. Because of that, the feeling of pleasure when acquiring equipment is also good.",
      "I really liked the die rolling and assigning mechanics, I think you did a good job hitting the theme of the round.\u00a0 nd I'd like to see this game get developed further.\u00a0Well done!",
      "Wow there is a lot of potential with this game, I really enjoyed playing this! Aside from the obvious UI touch-ups and more information given to the player (such as which color dice do what) I'd also recommend showing what the player has equipped so far when they're choosing their item reward after a battle.",
      "I liked this! A lot of potential, I would like to play an actual roguelike game like this. Just add more strategy and abilities and enemies and it will be perfect.\u00a0I recommend making a webgl build in the future tho, especially if continuing with unity, you deserve more people to try this out but downloadable files tend to scare them away.",
      "It might be my wide screen monitor but some stuff was cut out on the bottom of the screen.\u00a0 Very interesting game premise hope to see it the project continue one way or another!",
      "This has the bones for a great game. Well done on the prototype!",
      "Short and gets to the point fast. I do like myself some dice rolling, but for some reason I kept getting ones and twos, no clue what that was about. Could probably be expanded upon very easily as a hobby project."

If you continue to work on it, you might want to add some detail to the floor or the background to give visual feedback that the player is moving around in the level (since the level is bigger than one screen, and the camera follows the player). On the (Linux) desktop version I sometimes had to click the weapon to discard multiple times before it worked (not game breaking but would be nice to fix).",

The dialogue was is aslo really\u00a0entertaing. Congrats on making my favorite game of this first round and I hope to see your works on the next rounds.",

      "This is so far my favorite game about gravity rotation. Which is actualy cool beacuse its third one.\u00a0 Sometimes it bugs for some reason.",

      "This is a cool idea! Had a bit of trouble with the controls, but this game has a lot of potential!",
      "Very fun idea! the platforming in and of itself was good, though the gravity swapping was a bit hard to do with any agility",
      "Thanks for all this comments",
      "Great concept, I\u00a0love gravity switching games. Controls were a little awkward but nothing I couldn't get used to. I'd like to see this developed further.",
      "Well done, super challenging platformer. If you tighten up the controls and the gravity switching mechanic I'd love to see this project evolve into a full game."

      "Nice concept! The 2D side would have benefited from some coyote time for the jump. Like Dev Pirates said it would be cool if the 3D side could be used to progress on the 2D side as well.",
      "This could've been something like \"We were here\" but it was a extremely thin slice of a very cookie cutter platformer. The graphics were simple and served their purpose well. Not that many features or elements to comment on.",
      "Making the way through\u00a0the 3D level and the 2D level is a really great idea. I liked the buttons in the 2D part that helped the progression of the 3D. I think you hit the theme of the challenge really well and it was a lot of fun. Well done!",
      "This is soo cool! I liked this so much!",
      "This was really interesting and very original.\u00a0\u00a0I was great jumping in 3d, but my 2d game was terrible (not your fault - mine). \u00a0I enjoyed this and hope you get a chance to continue it.",

      "Now that the game is working, it is an artsy game. The game itself is short and simple, but the art style does most of the heavy lifting. Now just more areas, interactions or something completely different and it could stand on its own. AlsoThe giant is real.",
      "I LOVE YOUR ART OMGsorry for the caps..i love your take on this im assuming the core is to collect items and to support that and progress you give the food to the animals and when you give them food they are coloured giving a sense that they're happy nowpretty simple idea but well executed as a prototype this is greati'd love to see this being developed furtheroh yeah btw a random thing happen where the characters leg went so big after i put the berries down near the bushi jumped thought the girl went giant mode \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00ad",

      "I really like your art style and even though this was a very simple game, you managed to add a lot of personality to it, which is something a lot of devs (including myself) seems to struggle with. The game itself\u00a0was very intuitive and easy to progress.",

      "I really went out of my way to try and play this game, but everything I could come up with failed. Download gamemaker and the file throws a million errors, not even the yyp fixer works as it isn't a \"valid project\". Can't really give a rating without having even touched the game itself, a shame honestly.",

      "Very cool game concept and mechanics. It's a little tough, but maybe\u00a0I'm just bad LOL. It would be cool to be able to rotate in either direction and to slow the initial game down a little. Great job though, really enjoyed it!",
      "I unfortunately couldn't get past the first spikes as I have such a skill issue with precise games, so I probably missed entirely what the secondary mechanic was. The graphics were nice enough that I probably would've wanted to play more if I could've. Not going to say what the camera's problem was as everyone else has already said it.",
      "Very rage inducing but very very fun! the rotating effect is a lil much but Its cool!!",
      "Very dizzy now. Great game with good mechanics. Loved the winding up of the doors and the no spin zones mixed with the treadmills. Great game!",
      "Great game! I couldn't play for too long because of the spinning, but had lots of fun!",
      "",
      "This was so freakin' fun to play on stream.\u00a0 I could see this being a fantastic game on mobile especially.",
      "Really clever and original idea. \u00a0Definitely a dizzying. \u00a0I started out okay, but it got too hard (for me) really fast. \u00a0I think just spinning a little slower would help it (both for dizzy and skill). \u00a0Still, it was very fun.",
      "Good job. I had fun.",
      "loved thistho the spinning made me dizzy a bit lolnice work man!i think our characater might wanna take some dizzy medicine",
      "Are you crazy man? How did you come up with all these systems? I am sick of all the spinning, and each obstacle you threw my way kept me wanting to try even more! I was so close to giving up ALL THE TIME! But then you had a new way to interact with the game I was even more hooked!I had to stop on that winding path that I had to screw in 3-4\u00a0 bulbs at the start to turn (Another genius interaction!!!) but then I reached the end, admittedly after taking my (spoon)sweet time, and the door was closed... that was my final moment :D Let me know if there is more or if someone actually streamed the next puzzles! Amazing game!",
      "Fun and interesting mechanic that was surprisingly challenging! Agreed with others that the camera spinning was a little offputting and made it difficult to look at and follow, but I really like the idea overall",
      "I really enjoyed this one. It starts off so simple, but you really explored a lot of mechanics to ramp up the difficulty with the areas that lock your rotation and the timed gates and stuff. I really appreciated the generous checkpointing as well as I found the pretty tough. Great work on this I\u00a0like it!",
      "Was slightly nauseating but extremely fun! I didn't want to stop playing but I had to\u00a0due to the spins getting to me. extremely fun and I could see this being fleshed out into a full game, good job!",
      "Great execution of the task! The camera spinning makes it a bit hard to look at though",
      "This to me was a perfect submission for the criteria!\u00a0 Really brilliant use of level design with simple and easy to grasp mechanics to make a game that I had a lot of fun with.\u00a0 First all fives of the round for me!",

      "Great idea and great execution! I also agree that rotating the character would make the game more accessible, but this was a fun experience nonetheless.",
      "Banger game, but please just make the character rotate instead of the screen. I got nauseous playing for like 5 minutes. The core and secondary mechanic are super well implemented.\u00a0Great job!!"

I do think the game should be fully beatable without it, though, as it isn't greatly intuitive and a little temperamental. I'd love to see new levels and mechanics in the future, well done!",

      "I had a lot of fun playing and trying out the different abilities. However, I felt like the mushroom platforms were too overpowered, since you can \"chain\" them together to reach basically anywhere",
      "This is really, really good. The mechanic is well implemented and fun, and can be built upon super easily.",
      "The idea here was quite top notch, and it could really be expanded upon easily. Of course this is just a jam game so can't expect the world from it. Graphics and audio fit the retro theme well.",
      "That was very cleverly done :) I have to admit, I got stuck on the pit of spikes but had a good time all the same.",
      "I like the game mechanics quite a lot. Riding the snail is awesome and its a really well put together game overall",
      "Really fun and genius mechanics done very well. The taking and then putting the items into the world gave some really fun puzzle mechanics. You provided a nice level too. Well done!",
      "WOW! This was a soo nice idea! Very polished, cute and fun game!",
      "This is a little hidden gem. Really clever idea with the mechanics and kept me entertained till I escaped with my little friends in the spaceship. Mechanics were good. Cool game!",
      "Very interesting idea! I wish character movement were a little bit more\u00a0responsive )",
      "I think this is genuinely a cool idea! All the items serve pretty much the same purpose, but each do it in a unique way! The basic movement controls could definitely use some work, not being able to jump with space bar had me slipping off the edge way more often than I want to admit. Given more time this could be an awesome game!",
      "Really cool game! Love the different things to captures and the mechanics of them. Found a bug: If two mushrooms are close to eachother and I shoot them, the stem is left from one of them and I only get one mushroom back to my inventory:"
